{"text":"The preparation of suitable hole transport material (HTM) is critical to the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with low-cost. Herein, a mass producible and soluble copper phthalocyanine decorated with butoxy donor groups (CuPc-OBu) was designed as HTM and prepared by a facile two-step synthetic route. To generate high quality HTM film, 4-tertbutylpyridine (tBP) was doped into CuPc-OBu to prepare the film and then removed by annealing. Such a tBP-assisted strategy resulted in the best efficiency of the PSCs with lead trihalide perovskite up to 19.0% (small-area of 0.1 cm2) and 10.1% (the active area of 8.0 cm2 for the module device). And the best efficiency of the tin-based PSCs with CuPc-OBu reached to 6.9%. More importantly, the device with CuPc-OBu as HTM revealed the remarkably enhanced stability. This work provides a new strategy to improve the film-quality of free-doping HTMs and enhance the efficiency and stability of Pb- and Sn-based PSCs with low-cost.","meta":{"doi":"803665"},"tokens":[[{"start":28,"end":51,"text":"hole transport material","annotation":"APL"},{"start":53,"end":56,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":93,"end":102,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":106,"end":128,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":130,"end":134,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":189,"end":245,"text":"copper phthalocyanine decorated with butoxy donor groups","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":247,"end":255,"text":"CuPc-OBu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":273,"end":276,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":295,"end":326,"text":"facile two-step synthetic route","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":353,"end":356,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":357,"end":361,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":363,"end":382,"text":"4-tertbutylpyridine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":384,"end":387,"text":"tBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":393,"end":398,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":404,"end":412,"text":"CuPc-OBu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":428,"end":432,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":471,"end":474,"text":"tBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":514,"end":524,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":532,"end":536,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":542,"end":567,"text":"lead trihalide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":679,"end":689,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":697,"end":700,"text":"tin","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":707,"end":711,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":717,"end":725,"text":"CuPc-OBu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":777,"end":785,"text":"CuPc-OBu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":789,"end":792,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":826,"end":835,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":914,"end":918,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":935,"end":945,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":950,"end":959,"text":"stability","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":963,"end":965,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":971,"end":973,"text":"Sn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":980,"end":984,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":764,"created_at":"2023-03-09T07:50:49.171679Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T07:50:49.171679Z","lead_time":131.289}

Following the steady-state technique, we measured the thermal conductivity of around 1 W m−1 K−1 in the temperature range 100–300 K on 2 × 2 mm2 size crystal.

However, relatively low opening circuit voltage (Voc) and limited moisture stability have lagged their progress far from the regular. Here, we propose an effective surface treatment strategy with high-temperature FABr treatment to address these issues. The induced ions exchange can not only adjust energy level, but also gift effective passivation. Meanwhile, the gradient distribution of FA+ can accelerate the carriers transport to further suppress bulk recombination. Besides, the Br-rich surface and FA+ substitution can isolate moisture erosions. As a result, the optimized devices show champion efficiency of 15.92% with Voc of 1.223 V.

The self-trapping strongly depends on the dimensionality of the materials. In the three-dimensional case, there is a potential barrier for self-trapping, whereas no such barrier is present for quasi-one-dimensional systems. Two-dimensional (2D) systems are marginal cases with a much lower potential barrier or nonexistent potential barrier for the self-trapping, leading to the easier formation of self-trapped states.

In particular, self-trapped excitons are present in 2D perovskites and can significantly influence the optical and electrical properties of 2D perovskites due to the soft characteristic and strong electron-phonon interaction.

{"text":"Low-dimensional halide perovskites (HPs) have received considerable attention in recent years due to their novel physical properties such as compositional flexibility, high quantum yield, quantum size effects and superior charge transport. Here we show room temperature solution synthesis of 1D organic-inorganic lead bromide perovskite microwires (MWs). Our method uses acetone as a reactant, and when CH3NH3PbBr3 is immersed, acetone reacts with CH3NH3+ cations in the CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal by the dehydration condensation. The reaction generates a large (CH3)2C = NHCH3+ A-site which cannot be accommodated by the cuboctahedron formed by the corner-sharing [PbBr6]4− octahedral, leading to the transition of corner-sharing octahedra to face-sharing triangular prism and the crystal structure transformation from 3D to 1D. The formation process of (CH3)2C = NHCH3PbBr3 MWs does not involve any ligands, templates or catalysts. A two-terminal memory device was constructed using the (CH3)2C = NHCH3PbBr3 MWs, showing great potential of the method in fabrication of electronic and optoelectronic devices.","meta":{"doi":"803655"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"Low-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":16,"end":34,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":36,"end":39,"text":"HPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":113,"end":132,"text":"physical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":141,"end":166,"text":"compositional flexibility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":173,"end":186,"text":"quantum yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":188,"end":208,"text":"quantum size effects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":222,"end":238,"text":"charge transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":313,"end":336,"text":"lead bromide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":337,"end":347,"text":"microwires","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":292,"end":294,"text":"1D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":349,"end":352,"text":"MWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":403,"end":414,"text":"CH3NH3PbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":448,"end":455,"text":"CH3NH3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":471,"end":482,"text":"CH3NH3PbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":562,"end":569,"text":"(CH3)2C","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":572,"end":578,"text":"NHCH3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":665,"end":674,"text":"[PbBr6]4−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":622,"end":635,"text":"cuboctahedron","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":675,"end":685,"text":"octahedral","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":731,"end":740,"text":"octahedra","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":757,"end":773,"text":"triangular prism","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":820,"end":822,"text":"3D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":826,"end":828,"text":"1D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":855,"end":862,"text":"(CH3)2C","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":865,"end":875,"text":"NHCH3PbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":876,"end":879,"text":"MWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":989,"end":996,"text":"(CH3)2C","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":999,"end":1009,"text":"NHCH3PbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1010,"end":1013,"text":"MWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1071,"end":1108,"text":"electronic and optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":754,"created_at":"2023-03-09T07:19:26.854398Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T07:19:26.854398Z","lead_time":235.384}

This review discusses the current status of lead-free, all-inorganic halide perovskite quantum dots (LFAIHP QDs).

{"text":"In this work, high quality uniform and dense nanostructured cobalt-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Co) films were used as electron-transport layers in CH3NH3PbI3-based planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) on a flexible conductive substrate. Highly photo catalytically active ZnO:Co films were prepared by a low cost hydrothermal process using the aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate, hexamethylenete-tramine and cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate. ZnO:Co films were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) covered polyethylene terephthalate (PET) flexible substrates. The growth was controlled by maintaining the autoclave temperature at 150 °C for 4 h. The CH3NH3PbI3 layer was deposited on the ZnO:Co films by spin coating. Spiro-OMeTAD was employed as a hole-transporting material. The structural, morphology and optical properties of the grown ZnO nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microcopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and photoelectrochemical propriety. XRD spectra showed that both ZnO and ZnO:Co nanorods had a hexagonal wurtzite structure with a strong preferred orientation along the (002) plane. The surface morphology of films was studied by FESEM and showed that both the pure and Co-doped ZnO films had hexagonal shaped nanorods. In the steady state, the ZnO electrode gave a photocurrent density of about 1.5 mA/cm2. However, the Co-doped ZnO electrode showed a photocurrent density of about 6 mA/cm2, which is 4-fold higher than that of the ZnO electrode. Based on the above synthesized Co-doped ZnO films, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was studied. The Co-doped ZnO layers had a significant impact on the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs. The latter was attributed to an efficient charge separation and transport due to the better coverage of perovskite on the nanostructured Co-doped ZnO films. As a result, the measured PCE under standard solar conditions (A M 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) reached 7%. SCAPS-1D simulation was also performed to analyze the effect of the co-doped ZnO thin film on the corresponding solar cell performances.","meta":{"doi":"803653"},"tokens":[[{"start":39,"end":59,"text":"dense nanostructured","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":60,"end":83,"text":"cobalt-doped zinc

{"text":"Metal halide perovskites have received considerable attention in the field of electroluminescence, and the external quantum efficiency of perovskite light-emitting diodes has exceeded 20%. CH3NH3PbBr3 has been intensely investigated as an emitting layer in perovskite light-emitting diodes. However, perovskite films comprising CH3NH3PbBr3 often exhibit low surface coverage and poor crystallinity, leading to high current leakage, severe nonradiative recombination, and limited device performance. Herein, we demonstrate a rationale for composition engineering to obtain high-quality perovskite films. We first reduce pinholes by adding excess CH3NH3Br to the actual CH3NH3PbBr3 films, and we then add CsBr to improve the crystalline quality and to passivate nonradiative defects. As a result, the (CH3NH3)1−xCsxPbBr3 based perovskite light-emitting diodes exhibit significantly improved external quantum and power efficiencies of 6.97% and 25.18 lm/W, respectively, representing an improvement in performance dozens of times greater than that of pristine CH3NH3PbBr3-based perovskite light-emitting diodes.

{"text":"Transition-metal oxide perovskites usually exhibit mixed ionic and electronic conductivity and have been widely investigated as electrode materials for use in solid-oxide fuel cells. Recently, samarium nickelate SmNiO3 was found experimentally to show promising potential for use in proton-conducting fuel cells. To understand the ionic conductivity of SmNiO3, the oxygen and proton diffusion therein are investigated via density functional theory calculations in this work. Based on the vacancy hopping mechanism, oxygen diffusion in SmNiO3 shows a migration barrier of 0.84 eV. The proton diffusion is studied in terms of different diffusion mechanisms, including reorientation, intraoctahedral, and interoctahedral hopping. The migration barrier for intraoctahedral migration is calculated to be lower than that for interoctahedral hopping. To realize long-range diffusion, the proton is predicted to exhibit reorientation and intraoctahedral hopping.

{"text":"Substantiation of using a carbothermal method for processing flotation perovskite concentrate is presented. Results of X-ray structural studies of compacted specimens after two sintering stages are provided. It is shown that titanium carbide is formed in the first stage, and in the second stage calcium carbide is formed followed by dissociation into calcium metal and graphite. A dependence is obtained for the degree of transformation of titanium carbide on isothermal exposure duration and excess carbon in the initial charge. Dependence of degree of calcium extraction on isothermal exposure duration is demonstrated. It is shown that the temperature for the beginning of calcium carbidization at a given pressure is ≈ 1600°C. It is established that briquette compaction pressure has almost no effect on calcium extraction, while it affects briquette mechanical strength.Thermodynamic calculations of equilibrium compositions of phases in contact involved in production processes are performed using HSC Chemistry application software. Results of differential-thermal and thermogravimetric analyses of a charge of a given composition of flotation perovskite and soot are analyzed. In order to study kinetic regularities, correlation coefficients of isothermal exposure duration and reaction rate constant are calculated using kinetic equations of Yander, Gistling–Brownstein, Zhuravlev–Lesokhin–Tempel’man, anti-Gistling, anti-Yander, and Tamman. Apparent activation energy for the first stage of the carbothermal process is calculated using a specific model taking account of results of experiments conducted at different temperatures (Ea = 311.48 kJ/mol). It is established that the dependence obtained for the degree of transformation on isothermal exposure duration is most adequately described by an anti-Yander model formal kinetics equation. Optimum production conditions are selected for the process on the basis of research results: briquette pressing pressure is 8.57 MPa; first stage temperature 1500°C and 1750°C in the second stage; heating rate 17°C/min and 9°C/min respectively. In this case exposure time is 120 min and 60 min in the first and second stages, and residual pressure is 50 Pa and 13.3·10–3 Pa respectively.","meta":{"doi":"803649"},"tokens":[[{"start":26,"end":45,"text":"carbothermal method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":71,"end":81,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":119,"end":143,"text":"X-ray structural studies","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":225,"end":241,"text":"titanium carbide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":296,"end":311,"text":"calcium carbide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":352,"end":365,"text":"calcium metal","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":370,"end":378,"text":"graphite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":441,"end":457,"text":"titanium carbide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":501,"end":507,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":555,"end":562,"text":"calcium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":677,"end":684,"text":"calcium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":809,"end":816,"text":"calcium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1152,"end":1162,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1461,"end":1478,"text":"activation energy","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":748,"created_at":"2023-03-09T06:35:08.041237Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T06:35:08.041237Z","lead_time":414.603}

Their low-cost and low temperature synthesis have made them attractive for extensive research aimed at revolutionizing the semiconductor industry. The rich chemistry of metal halide perovskites allows compositional engineering resulting in facile tuning of the desired optoelectronic properties. Moreover, using different experimental synthesis and deposition techniques such as solution processing, chemical vapor deposition and hot-injection methods, the dimensionality of the perovskites can be altered from 3D to 0D, each structure opening a new realm of applications due to their unique properties. Dimensionality engineering includes both morphological engineering-reducing the thickness of 3D perovskite into atomically thin films-and molecular engineering-incorporating long-chain organic cations into the perovskite mixture and changing the composition at the molecular level. The optoelectronic properties of the perovskite structure including its band gap, binding energy and carrier mobility depend on both its composition and dimensionality. The plethora of different photodetectors and solar cells that have been made with different compositions and dimensions of perovskite will be reviewed here.

In the presence of trace water, part of Cs4PbBr6 NCs (non-fluorescent) was converted to CsPbBr3 NCs (strong fluorescent). Using anthracene as the reference fluorophore, the brightness ratio of the green (from CsPbBr3 NCs) to blue (from anthracene) components in the fluorescence image which was recorded in situ by the smartphone camera was measured as the signal for kinetic analysis. It was shown that the water-triggered conversion reaction from Cs4PbBr6 NCs to CsPbBr3 NCs follows the pseudo-second-order kinetic model in the early rapid hydrolysis stage (up to 4 min). With increasing water content, the hydrolysis of Cs4PbBr6 NCs is promoted to yield more CsPbBr3 NCs, which was used to determine trace water in n-hexane, dichloromethane, and toluene with detection limits of 0.031, 0.043, and 0.057 μL mL−1, respectively.

Structural characterizations revealed the formation of the hexagonal structure in SBI thin films, and also showed improvement in the surface morphology in the MWCNT and RGO-doped thin films. All absorber layers had a relatively high absorption coefficient above 104 cm−1 in the visible range, and the bandgap values varied between ∼ 1.83 eV and 2.04 eV. Also, we fabricated SBI-based solar cells, and their photovoltaic performance was studied. For the solar cell employing pure silver bismuth iodide, a photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.44% was achieved.

{"text":"Organometallic halide-perovskite solar cells have undergone massive improvements in power conversion efficiency in the past decade, from around 4% in 2009 to 24% in 2019. A hotly debated issue in this field involves the investigation of economical, stable and power-efficient hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials in order to improve overall device performance and feasibility of mass production in the coming years. Even though the conventional (n-i-p) structure continues to be the most commonly used in perovskite solar cells, research in the field has shown that its potential for further commercial application is limited due to the higher J–V hysteresis and need for high temperature during fabrication. To address this issue, inverted (p-i-n) perovskite structures have been seriously examined because of their straightforward processability at low and moderate temperatures. These investigations have established that the HTMs are a significant part of the inverted (p-i-n) perovskite structure, which can render shape to a specific contact. They are perfect for reducing charge recombination and effective hole collection to enhance the overall performance of the device. This article examines in minute detail the different characteristics of inorganic hole transport materials used in inverted perovskite structures over the past decade, including power conversion efficiency, device configuration, energy band position and synthesis methods. It goes on to briefly discuss the stability analysis conducted to identify the factors which make perovskite unstable, so that possible ways to further optimize the performance parameters may be derived from the observations.","meta":{"doi":"803632"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":44,"text":"Organometallic halide-perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":84,"end":111,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":276,"end":300,"text":"hole transport materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":302,"end":306,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":312,"end":340,"text":"electron transport materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":474,"end":479,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":533,"end":555,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":777,"end":787,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":770,"end":775,"text":"p-i-n","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":957,"end":961,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1002,"end":1007,"text":"p-i-n","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1009,"end":1019,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1107,"end":1127,"text":"charge recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1142,"end":1157,"text":"hole collection","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1290,"end":1314,"text":"hole transport materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1332,"end":1342,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1386,"end":1413,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1515,"end":1524,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1579,"end":1589,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":731,"created_at":"2023-03-09T02:05:26.534168Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T02:05:26.534168Z","lead_time":302.744}

X-ray diffraction analysis of samples indicates that the pure cubic structure was obtained for composition lower than x = 0.2. The OER studies indicate that substitution of iron by zinc increases the electrocatalytic activity of the resulting material significantly. The highest activity was achieved for x = 0.1, whereas the obtained current density was 9.02 mA cm−2 at 0.66 V, which is approximately three times higher than that of the base oxide. The Tafel slopes values for OER on each oxide in 1 M KOH are found to be ~89, 52, and 64 mV dec−1 for LaFeO3, LaFe0.9Zn0.1O3, and LaFe0.8Zn0.2O3, respectively.

{"text":"This study is a follow up to our previously published manuscript on “improved power conversion efficiency in Perovskite solar cell using silver nanoparticles modified photoanode”. Three more photoanodes were fabricated which are: Ag@P4VP NPs mixed with perovskite layer (S2), Ag@P4VP NPs simultaneously mixed both in TiO2 and perovskite films (S3) and P25 NP simultaneously mixed both in TiO2 and perovskite absorber (S4) and their performances were investigated systematically. The performance, especially the photocurrent, and open circuit voltage of PSCs made of Ag@P4VP NPs were significantly affected. The champion device is S3, which shows enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.80 to 9.05%, short circuit current density (Jsc) from 11.04 to 15.87 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.85 to 0.88 and fill factor (FF) from 0.41 to 0.65, which demonstrates ~ 2.38 times improvement in PCE over the control device (C). When Ag@P4VP NPs was mixed with TiO2, PCE of 5.69%, Jsc of 12.61 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.88 V and FF of 0.51 were achieved, which shows ~ 1.50 times improvement over the performance of the reference cell. Also, when Ag@P4VP NPs was mixed with the perovskite layer, PCE of 8.08%, Jsc of 14.18 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.89 V and FF of 0.64 were achieved, which shows ~ 2.13 times improvement over the performance of the pristine device. The addition of Ag@P4VP NPs enhanced exciton generation and dissociation, encouraging charge separation/transfer, as well as reducing quenching losses. For the hysteresis test, it was found that the devices with Ag@P4VP NPs have almost identical J–V curves with negligible hysteresis, which is attributed to the significant reduction of the trap density of the perovskite film when Ag@P4VP NPs is incorporated to fill the pores with high trapping rate. We however observed hysteretic behavior in devices C and S4, which makes it difficult to estimate the real PCE.","meta":{"doi":"803626"},"tokens":[[{"start":77,"end":105,"text":" power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":109,"end":130,"text":"Perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":137,"end":143,"text":"silver","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":144,"end":157,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":167,"end":177,"text":"photoanode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":191,"end":202,"text":"photoanodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":230,"end":237,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":238,"end":241,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":253,"end":263,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":276,"end":283,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":284,"end":287,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":317,"end":321,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":326,"end":336,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":337,"end":342,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":352,"end":355,"text":"P25","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":356,"end":358,"text":"NP","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":388,"end":392,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":397,"end":407,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":529,"end":549,"text":"open circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":511,"end":523,"text":"photocurrent","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":553,"end":557,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":566,"end":573,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":574,"end":577,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":661,"end":688,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":690,"end":693,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":715,"end":744,"text":"short circuit current density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":746,"end":749,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":780,"end":800,"text":"open circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":802,"end":805,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":829,"end":840,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":842,"end":844,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":912,"end":915,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":950,"end":957,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":958,"end":961,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":977,"end":981,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":983,"end":986,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":997,"end":1000,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1019,"end":1022,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1037,"end":1039,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1155,"end":1162,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1163,"end":1166,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1186,"end":1196,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1204,"end":1207,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1218,"end":1221,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1240,"end":1243,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1258,"end":1260,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1382,"end":1389,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1390,"end":1393,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1578,"end":1585,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1586,"end":1589,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1748,"end":1755,"text":"Ag@P4VP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1756,"end":1759,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1926,"end":1929,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":725,"created_at":"2023-03-09T01:46:18.242470Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T01:46:18.242470Z","lead_time":278.037}

Here, we developed a two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for growing quaternary IHP CsPbX3 (X = Cl/Br and Br/I) alloys. By exploiting the fast diffusion of halide anions in IHPs, the alloy composition can be precisely controlled by the growth time of the respective layers once the growth of the individual ternary IHP is optimized. Hence complexities in the multi-parameter optimization in the conventional CVD growth of quaternary alloys can be mitigated. Using this process, we synthesized single crystalline, homogeneous and thermally stable CsPbCl3(1−X)Br3x and CsPbBr3(1−X)I3x perovskites alloy microplates and demonstrated continuously tunable emission covering the spectrum from 428 to 715 nm by varying the halide compositions in the alloys.

{"text":"In the conventional n-i-p structure of perovskite solar cell (PSC), spiro-OMeTAD is used as the hole transport layer. However, some additives in spiro-OMeTAD, such as LiTFSI and TBP, can bring risks for perovskite degradation. Nickel oxide (NiO), a wide-band gap (3.6–4.0 eV) p-type semiconductor material with excellent electrical and optical properties, is widely applied in the PSCs and other fields. Given the suitable valence and conduction bands, NiO can effectively block electrons and transport holes, which are generated in the perovskite film after illumination. However, depositing a compact and thin NiO layer on the perovskite film is difficult because of the heat and solvent sensitivity of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite. Here, we propose a facile method to prepare well-dissolved NiO nanoparticles in chlorobenzene, and the NiO film on perovskite is further modified by oxygen plasma or hexanethiol treatment to enhance the hole conductivity. Finally, we obtain a n-i-p structured PSC on the basis of all-inorganic charge transport layer with an efficiency of 4.21% using the prepared NiO film, and the value is further improved to 6.10% after oxygen plasma post-treatment. Moreover, the working stability is enhanced remarkably as the spiro-OMeTAD is replaced by NiO film, which is important for the application of PSCs.","meta":{"doi":"803618"},"tokens":[[{"start":39,"end":60,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":62,"end":65,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":68,"end":80,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":20,"end":25,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":96,"end":116,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":145,"end":157,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":167,"end":173,"text":"LiTFSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":178,"end":181,"text":"TBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":203,"end":213,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":227,"end":239,"text":"Nickel oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":241,"end":244,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":249,"end":262,"text":"wide-band gap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":283,"end":296,"text":"semiconductor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":321,"end":331,"text":"electrical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":336,"end":354,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":381,"end":385,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":453,"end":456,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":479,"end":488,"text":"electrons","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":493,"end":508,"text":"transport holes","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":537,"end":547,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":548,"end":552,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":612,"end":615,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":629,"end":639,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":640,"end":644,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":730,"end":740,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":801,"end":804,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":805,"end":818,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":822,"end":835,"text":"chlorobenzene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":845,"end":848,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":849,"end":853,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":857,"end":867,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":985,"end":990,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1002,"end":1005,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1036,"end":1058,"text":"charge transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1106,"end":1109,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1110,"end":1114,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1217,"end":1226,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1257,"end":1269,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1285,"end":1288,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1289,"end":1293,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1337,"end":1341,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":717,"created_at":"2023-03-08T04:14:12.912132Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T04:14:12.912132Z","lead_time":195.58}

It was found that the mode of Pd incorporation and subsequent aging has a limited impact on the catalytic performance at low temperature for the NO/H2 reaction. On the other hand, sharp rate enhancement in NO and methane conversion occurs at high temperature related to change in the reaction pathway from methane combustion to reforming reactions producing more efficient reducing agents to reduce NO.

For 2-step PSCs based on thermal evaporation, the complete conversion of PbI2 into the perovskite structure is a key parameter for device performance. To achieve complete conversion, we regulated the morphology of the PbI2 layer by controlling the growth rate. Compared to rapidly grown PbI2 layers, a PbI2 layer grown at a slow rate contained pinholes that enhanced the diffusion of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) from the PbI2 surface. Despite the assistance of the pinholes, the conversion of the PbI2 was incomplete due to the limited interaction between the MAI and PbI2. Complete conversion of the pinhole-rich PbI2 occurred by introducing an additive into the MAI solution. The conversion of PbI2 was measured by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering using synchrotron X-rays. By controlling the incidence angle of the X-rays, we quantitatively compared the amount of PbI2 as a function of the X-ray penetration depth.

{"text":"Density functional theory (DFT) investigation is performed to observe the opto-electronic properties of iridium and copper co-doped structure of Pristine SrTiO3 (Cubic Perovskite). Results suggest that copper and iridium co-doped structure of SrTiO3 has significant absorption in visible region of the spectrum, which is a result of red shift phenomenon in the wavelength range 400–750 nm observed in this structure. However, in individual copper and iridium structures the optical absorption is mainly in ultraviolet (UV) region which limits its use in light-based devices and applications. The shift in absorption from UV to visible region in the co-doped structure extracts the maximum utilization of solar light and finds wide range of optical applications like solar cells.

{"text":"In alkyl ammonium lead halide based perovskites, the replacement of toxic Pb+2 with a suitable nontoxic divalent metal cation without losing the photovoltaic performance is one of the prime challenges to the researchers. The understanding of the effect of replacing Pb+2 on the structural and optical properties of alkyl ammonium lead halide based perovskites, and thereafter correlating their photovoltaic performances, comprise a fundamental study which is important towards developing efficient and non-toxic solar cells. In the present work, we used a wet chemical process to substitute Pb+2 with Sn+2 in different proportions into CH3NH3PbxSn(1−x)Cl3. The value of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, which is a measure of structural stability of the perovskite lattice, was estimated theoretically. The theoretical calculations were correlated further with the experimentally obtained x-ray diffraction patterns of the original and substituted perovskites. The optical properties of CH3NH3Pb(1−x)SnxCl3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) perovskite thin-films were investigated by the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy. The bandgap energy (Eg) for CH3NH3Pb(1−x)SnxCl3(0 ≤ x ≤ 1) were estimated from the optical absorption spectra. The Urbach energy (EU) which predicts defects, disorder and crystalline imperfections within semiconducting thin-films were estimated for the prepared perovskite thin films. The steepness parameter which apprises about strength of electron–phonon (Ee–p) interaction within perovskites were also estimated from the optical absorbance spectra to understand the effect of replacing Pb+2 with Sn+2. In addition, the variations in the surface morphologies of the prepared perovskites were studied using scanning electron microscopy. The I–V characteristics of the different cells were analysed and, finally, we attempted to correlate their photovoltaic performances with the opto-structural properties.","meta":{"doi":"803606"},"tokens":[[{"start":3,"end":47,"text":"alkyl ammonium lead halide based perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":74,"end":78,"text":"Pb+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":145,"end":169,"text":"photovoltaic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":266,"end":270,"text":"Pb+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":278,"end":288,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":293,"end":311,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":315,"end":359,"text":"alkyl ammonium lead halide based perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":394,"end":419,"text":"photovoltaic performances","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":512,"end":523,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":591,"end":595,"text":"Pb+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":601,"end":605,"text":"Sn+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":636,"end":655,"text":"CH3NH3PbxSn(1−x)Cl3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":726,"end":746,"text":"structural stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":674,"end":702,"text":"Goldschmidt tolerance factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":754,"end":764,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":888,"end":906,"text":" x-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":948,"end":959,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":965,"end":983,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":987,"end":1018,"text":"CH3NH3Pb(1−x)SnxCl3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1019,"end":1029,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1030,"end":1040,"text":"thin-films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1066,"end":1118,"text":"ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) absorption spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1124,"end":1138,"text":"bandgap energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1148,"end":1178,"text":"CH3NH3Pb(1−x)SnxCl3(0 ≤ x ≤ 1)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1235,"end":1248,"text":"Urbach energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1250,"end":1252,"text":"EU","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1324,"end":1338,"text":"semiconducting","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1339,"end":1349,"text":"thin-films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1382,"end":1392,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1393,"end":1403,"text":"thin films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1504,"end":1515,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1610,"end":1614,"text":"Pb+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1620,"end":1624,"text":"Sn+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1729,"end":1757,"text":"scanning electron microscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1698,"end":1709,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1866,"end":1891,"text":"photovoltaic performances","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1901,"end":1927,"text":"opto-structural properties","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":705,"created_at":"2023-03-08T02:36:37.110734Z","updated_at":"2023-03-08T02:36:37.110734Z","lead_time":319.217}

Three different isolation types, unetched ITO, etched ITO, and laser etching whole devices, have been induced to investigate the physical isolation roles. The results show that the electrons and holes could be collected efficiently in active area for all the isolation types.

{"text":"Currently, lead halide perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) have attracted great attention due to their spectacular photophysical properties.

The monodispersed CsPbX3:Mn2+ PeQDs exhibit excellent photophysical properties, including high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 87%. The reaction process and doping mechanism are deeply explored through in-situ monitoring. By simply adjusting the halide composition of the original Cs4PbX6 PeQDs or Mn doping concentration, a series of CsPbX3:Mn2+ PeQDs with adjustable emission could be obtained. Further, the CsPbX3:Mn2+ Q-LED was fabricated and exhibited excellent orange light with the color coordinates of (0.564, 0.399), correlated color temperature (CCT) of 1,918 K, and luminous efficiency (LE) of 24 lm/W, which illustrate the great promise in light emitting diode (LED) applications.

{"text":"Carbon-based fully printable perovskite solar cells (CFP-PSCs) are attracting interests of many researchers, because of their easy large-scale fabrication and their high stability. In order to improve the photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs, it is necessary to optimize the crystallization processes of perovskite films. Hydrogen iodide (HI) additive enhances the solubility of PbI2 or PbCl2 and retards the growth of perovskite crystals, resulting in round-shaped crystals and high photovoltaic efficiency. In this paper, the effects of HI additive on the PCE and stability of the CFP-PSCs are tested. It is found that PCE enhancement was achieved by mixing much smaller concentration of HI additive into the precursor solution as compared to the concentrations in other reports. The mesoscopic scaffolds might suppress the evaporation of HI additive, thereby enhancing the effects of HI additive. Adding 50 mg% HI into perovskite precursor solution, the many characteristics such as the penetrability of the precursor into the mesoscopic scaffolds, the crystallization of perovskite and charge transfer were improved, whereas charge recombination was reduced. Accordingly, the PCE of the devices with 50 mg% HI additive are improved from 10.12% (the device without HI additive) to 11.27%, corresponding 10% higher efficiency. The morphologies of perovskite crystals could be different between the inside and the surface of the mesoscopic scaffold due to the difference of the evaporation rates of HI additive. This result suggests that the removal dynamics of additive changes the effects of additive on the perovskite crystallization.","meta":{"doi":"803603"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":51,"text":"Carbon-based fully printable perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":53,"end":61,"text":"CFP-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":170,"end":179,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":205,"end":239,"text":"photovoltaic conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":241,"end":244,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":249,"end":253,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":316,"end":326,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":327,"end":332,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":334,"end":349,"text":"Hydrogen iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":351,"end":353,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":391,"end":395,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":399,"end":404,"text":"PbCl2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":431,"end":441,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":465,"end":477,"text":"round-shaped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":496,"end":519,"text":"photovoltaic efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":551,"end":553,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":570,"end":573,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":595,"end":603,"text":"CFP-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":578,"end":587,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":633,"end":636,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":702,"end":704,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":853,"end":855,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":899,"end":901,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":926,"end":928,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":934,"end":944,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1002,"end":1015,"text":"penetrability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1087,"end":1097,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1192,"end":1195,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1223,"end":1225,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1280,"end":1282,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1361,"end":1371,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1345,"end":1357,"text":"morphologies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1442,"end":1461,"text":"mesoscopic scaffold","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1512,"end":1514,"text":"HI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1042,"end":1062,"text":"mesoscopic scaffolds","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1623,"end":1633,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":798,"end":818,"text":"mesoscopic scaffolds","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":377,"end":387,"text":"solubility","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":702,"created_at":"2023-03-07T02:38:47.860462Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T02:38:47.860462Z","lead_time":208.973}
{"text":"Perovskite phase of CdTiO3 nanoparticles (CTO NP) was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method at 180 °C for 12 h and 24 h. It was then annealed at 1050 °C for 3 h. Perovskite CdTiO3@S nanocomposites (CTO@S NCs) with a needle-like morphology were synthesized by mixing CTO and S powders at 600 °C for 2 h. The obtained samples were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry analysis (TGA–DSC), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Zeta potential, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The optical, photoluminescence, and photocatalytic properties were investigated further. The diffuse reflection adsorption spectrum indicated that absorption peaks of the CTO@S NCs with the various S contents (5–30%) shifted towards the visible region. Tauc’s plots presented the band gap energy values for direct transitions, whereby 2.98 eV and 2.51 eV were obtained for CTO and CTO@S NCs (30), respectively. Photoluminescence spectra excited at both 370 nm and 400 nm wavelengths revealed a decline in the intensity of the emission spectra and had a minor red-shift at λex = 370 nm.

{"text":"Ion migration under stress is a major degradation challenge for commercialization of perovskite solar cells. This paper presents three different approaches to model the conductivity variation in perovskite films at elevated temperature, prolonged irradiation levels and strain induced in the lattice. The conductivity variation under any of these stressing conditions can represent ion migration across the perovskite layer because the conductivity is related to mobility and carrier densities. Ion migration can elevate the density of electrons/holes across the film if the stress condition reduce/lift the activation energy at the interface of the film and smoothens the ion passivation to the perovskite layer. In addition, the conductivity of the film is related to device metrics (e.g. fill factor) and also to materials properties (e.g. mobility and bandgap) and, therefore, it can be a significant measure of stress impact on device stability. For example, the conductivity falls under stress which represents the ion migration enhancement. In our modeling, we have shown that the conductivity is inversely related to temperature and strain (σ ∝ 1/kT, σ ∝ 1/ε) but is directly related to irradiation level (σ ∝ ξ1/2). We have fitted our modeling to experimental data reported in the literature and extracted the activation energy of ion migration mechanism under every stress condition. The band diagrams of the mechanism are presented and it is shown that stress can foster the ion migration by reducing the activation energy at the interfaces of the perovskite layer. However, the impact of heating is worse on film conductivity, whereas irradiation and strain have a moderate or slight effect on it, respectively. Our findings may provide a practical solution to obtain a measure of ion migration in perovskite solar cells for aging analysis of the cell stability and recovery rates under different stressing conditions.","meta":{"doi":"803597"},"tokens":[[{"start":85,"end":107,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":195,"end":205,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":206,"end":211,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":407,"end":417,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":476,"end":493,"text":"carrier densities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":536,"end":545,"text":"electrons","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":546,"end":551,"text":"holes","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":563,"end":567,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":608,"end":625,"text":"activation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":650,"end":654,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":696,"end":706,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":707,"end":712,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":751,"end":755,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":791,"end":802,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":856,"end":863,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":843,"end":851,"text":"mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":463,"end":471,"text":"mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":940,"end":949,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1516,"end":1533,"text":"activation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1559,"end":1569,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1570,"end":1575,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1620,"end":1624,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1625,"end":1637,"text":"conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1810,"end":1832,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1864,"end":1873,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":696,"created_at":"2023-03-07T02:22:18.448807Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T02:22:18.448807Z","lead_time":219.944}

{"text":"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attained considerable success within just a few recent years. This accomplishment is critically based on compositional modifications and morphology engineering of perovskite material or dependent upon prepared mesoporous-titanium dioxide (mp-TiO2). However, no analysis of the antisolvent role used for crystallization of perovskite has been undertaken. Herein, we investigated the role of the antisolvent in the performance of hole transport layer (HTL)-free PSC (HTL-free PSC) based on the following sandwich structure: glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2)/mp-TiO2/Perovskite (MAPI)/gold (Au). We studied perovskite layers with various porosities and layer thicknesses, and revealed that the generated pinholes had a major effect on the HTL-free PSC performance. A possible reason for this is that the pinhole in the MAPI layer does not allow the MAPI crystals to generate charge pathways to the TiO2 layer. The MAPI layer prepared by chlorobenzene demonstrated a compact and pinhole-free highly crystalline MAPI layer with enhanced optical and electrical characteristics. However, the MAPI layers prepared by toluene and diethyl ether suffered from severe recombination issues at the MAPI/TiO2 interconnect. The dark current/voltage (J–V) curve of the HTL-free PSC prepared using chlorobenzene shifted to higher voltage, suggesting a reduction of the backflow of charges at the interface. The J–V characteristics under illumination proved that the HTL-free PSC fabricated by chlorobenzene using as antisolvent in this study, had the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.65% along with open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) values of 0.8335 V, 11.964 mA/cm2, and 0.56, respectively.The enhancement in the performance of PSCs originates from improved perovskite film formation, more efficient electron charge extraction and reduced recombination process.","meta":{"doi":"803595"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"Perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":24,"end":28,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":198,"end":208,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":245,"end":255,"text":"mesoporous","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":256,"end":272,"text":"titanium dioxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":274,"end":281,"text":"mp-TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":357,"end":367,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":429,"end":440,"text":"antisolvent","annotation":"APL"},{"start":463,"end":483,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":485,"end":488,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":495,"end":498,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":500,"end":512,"text":"HTL-free PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":557,"end":562,"text":"glass","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":563,"end":587,"text":"fluorine-doped tin oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":589,"end":592,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":594,"end":606,"text":"compact-TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":608,"end":614,"text":"c-TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":616,"end":623,"text":"mp-TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":624,"end":634,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":636,"end":640,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":648,"end":650,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":642,"end":646,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":664,"end":674,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":761,"end":769,"text":"pinholes","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":796,"end":808,"text":"HTL-free PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":876,"end":880,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":906,"end":910,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":955,"end":959,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":971,"end":975,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1067,"end":1071,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1092,"end":1099,"text":"optical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1104,"end":1130,"text":"electrical characteristics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1145,"end":1149,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1244,"end":1248,"text":"MAPI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1249,"end":1253,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1272,"end":1292,"text":"dark current/voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1294,"end":1297,"text":"J–V","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1312,"end":1324,"text":"HTL-free PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1340,"end":1353,"text":"chlorobenzene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1453,"end":1456,"text":"J–V","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1508,"end":1520,"text":"HTL-free PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1598,"end":1625,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1627,"end":1630,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1652,"end":1672,"text":"open circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1674,"end":1677,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1680,"end":1701,"text":"short circuit current","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1703,"end":1706,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1713,"end":1724,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1726,"end":1728,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1826,"end":1830,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1856,"end":1866,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1867,"end":1871,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":694,"created_at":"2023-03-07T02:16:17.628546Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T02:16:17.628546Z","lead_time":224.42}

When the Cs+ fraction x is between 0.3 and 0.7, one part of Cs+ ions incorporated in the MAPbI3 lattice replaces MA+ ions (α-phase), while the other part forms a yellow photovoltaic-inactive δ-CsPbI3 phase.

The existing methods to prepare methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films render substantial structural defect density, particularly at the grain boundaries and film surface, constituting a challenge that hinders the further optoelectronic enhancement of perovskite solar cells. Herein, a unique approach was introduced: using a simple ethylammonium chloride (EACl) additive in perovskite precursor mixture to produce high-quality MAPbI3 thin films. The results indicated that EACl could encourage perovskite crystal growth without experiencing the intermediate phase formation and would evaporate from the perovskite after annealing. Additionally, a gradient perovskite structure was achieved using this technique, which impressively enhanced the performance of the perovskite films. A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% was achieved under the optimal amount of EACl, and the resultant efficient device could retain over 89% of the original PCE after aging for 1000 h at room temperature.

{"text":"Detrimental defects on perovskite grain boundaries (GBs) are critical factors that lead to non-radiative recombination and hysteresis. In this work, triazine-graph-diyne (Tra-GD), a nitrogen-rich two-dimensional (2D) material, was incorporated into the active layer of perovskite to modify the GBs. Tra-GD was found to distribute evenly over the bulk of the perovskite and has a strong interaction with the Pb2+ exposed at GBs, which enables it to effectively passivate GB defects and prevent ion migration. The results of Kelvin probe force microscopy and photoluminescence studies proved that the highly conjugated Tra-GD located at GBs could promote charge extraction and transport. Benefiting from defect passivation and more efficient carrier transport, the Tra-GD based device showed less non-radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the resultant device presented negligible hysteresis and yielded a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.33% in the MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cell. This approach was extended to the FAPbI3 system with a PCE of 21.16%. Our Tra-GD passivation strategy provides a useful approach to effectively improving the device performance and addressing hysteresis issues.","meta":{"doi":"803589"},"tokens":[[{"start":23,"end":33,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":34,"end":50,"text":"grain boundaries","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":52,"end":55,"text":"GBs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":149,"end":169,"text":"triazine-graph-diyne","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":171,"end":177,"text":"Tra-GD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":182,"end":190,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":196,"end":211,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":213,"end":215,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":253,"end":265,"text":"active layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":269,"end":279,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":294,"end":297,"text":"GBs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":299,"end":305,"text":"Tra-GD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":358,"end":368,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":407,"end":411,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":423,"end":426,"text":"GBs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":470,"end":472,"text":"GB","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":523,"end":551,"text":"Kelvin probe force microscop","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":557,"end":582,"text":"photoluminescence studies","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":617,"end":623,"text":"Tra-GD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":635,"end":638,"text":"GBs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":702,"end":720,"text":"defect passivation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":740,"end":757,"text":"carrier transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":763,"end":769,"text":"Tra-GD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":915,"end":942,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":944,"end":947,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":966,"end":972,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":979,"end":1000,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":973,"end":978,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1036,"end":1042,"text":"FAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1057,"end":1060,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1076,"end":1082,"text":"Tra-GD","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":688,"created_at":"2023-03-07T01:47:45.236482Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T01:47:45.236482Z","lead_time":300.808}
{"text":"One of the efficient strategies for improving the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is to reduce the interfacial recombination loss, as well as to control the crystalline growth of perovskite by using additives. In fully screen-printable␣hole transport material-free PSCs with carbon electrode, the perovskite penetrates into the mesoporous structure of three layers (TiO2, ZrO2, and carbon), thus it is suggested that improving the perovskite crystalline growth will be very important to decrease the charge recombination and improve the transport of electric charge carriers. In this work, we introduced polyethylene glycol (PEG) as an additive into the perovskite precursor solution, which effectively improved the photovoltaic performance of the device. We found that PEG addition could effectively increase the perovskite crystal size and thus decrease the interfacial recombination loss and improve the light absorption by the perovskite film. When PEG was added, the performance of the solar cell increased from 11.07% to 14.71%, while the long-term stability of the device also improved.","meta":{"doi":"803588"},"tokens":[[{"start":65,"end":87,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":89,"end":93,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":192,"end":203,"text":"perovskite ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":212,"end":221,"text":"additives","annotation":"APL"},{"start":249,"end":272,"text":"hole transport material","annotation":"APL"},{"start":278,"end":282,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":288,"end":294,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":295,"end":304,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":310,"end":320,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":379,"end":383,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":385,"end":389,"text":"ZrO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":395,"end":401,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":444,"end":454,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":617,"end":636,"text":"polyethylene glycol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":638,"end":641,"text":"PEG","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":667,"end":678,"text":"perovskite ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":783,"end":786,"text":"PEG","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":827,"end":837,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":944,"end":954,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":955,"end":959,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":966,"end":969,"text":"PEG","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1068,"end":1077,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":687,"created_at":"2023-03-07T01:42:42.847617Z","updated_at":"2023-03-07T01:42:42.847617Z","lead_time":931.016}

UV vis spectra of CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x films display an increased band gap from 1.59 eV (pure CH3NH3PbI3 film) to 2.37 eV (MAPb(SCN)2I films). Experimental XRD spectra of CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x films for increasing SCN− levels show a reduced angle of the (110) plane in the same trend as for the simulated tetragonal CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x structures. The calculated bandgap of simulated tetragonal CH3NH3Pb(SCN)xI3−x structures also increases with the SCN− concentration. Maximal efficiency, 4.56%, was gained from a carbon-based hole-transport layer (HTL)-free CH3NH3PbI3 (x = 0) perovskite solar cell. This is attributed to the low bandgap of CH3NH3PbI3 (1.59 eV).

Recently, the I-rich all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br has attracted tremendous attention for use in solar cell applications because of its suitable band gap and favorable photo and thermal stabilities. It has been reported that the undesirable phase degradation of the photoactive a phase CsPbI2Br to the non-perovskite δ phase could be triggered by high humidity. To obtain stable devices, it is thus important to protect CsPbI2Br from moisture. In this paper, CuI, a non-hygroscopic p-type hole-transporting material, is found to induce the phase degradation of α-CsPbI2Br to the δ-CsPbI2Br. The rate and extent of phase degradation of CsPbI2Br are closely associated with the heating temperature and coverage of a CuI granular capping layer. This discovery is different from the widely reported water-induced phase degradation of CsPbI2Br.

The asymmetry of the M(H) curves here investigated can be well described by a recently proposed model based on the unconventional relaxation of the SG-like moments during the hysteresis cycle.","meta":{"doi":"803581"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":16,"text":"La1.5Ba0.5CoMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":69,"end":110,"text":"robust negative exchange bias (EB) effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":415,"end":442,"text":"spontaneous EB (SEB) effect","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":680,"created_at":"2023-03-06T06:29:23.153123Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T06:29:23.153123Z","lead_time":87.873}

Three-dimensional (3D) perovskite analogues have shown outstanding potential in terms of power conversion efficiency; however, the concern about its long-term stability impede its industrial endeavour. One such approach is the development and employment of lower dimensional, i.e. layered perovskite, structures that aim to achieve an improved stability along with competitive photovoltaic performance.

{"text":"The chapter covers topics focused on analyzing and discussing structural, morphological, optical, and electrochemical parameters presented by advanced inorganic perovskites with general formula ABO3 to carry out the photocatalytic hydrogen generation efficiently. The chapter deals with the synthesis, controlled modification, and photocatalytic evaluation for LaBO3 (M = Co, Mn, Fe) and ATiO3 (A = Zn, Cd, Pb) metal transition perovskite families; as well as the modification of LaBO3 perovskites through the formation of g-C3N4/LaBO3 heterostructures. It also analyzes the photoelectrocatalytic activity of an efficient BaBiO3/NaTaO3 heterojunction that improves the charge transfer mechanisms and decreases the charge carrier’s recombination. The substitution of cation A in ATiO3 (A = Zn, Cd, Pb) promoted important structural changes. CdTiO3 and ZnTiO3 crystallized in a rhombohedral structure; additionally, traces of TiO2 caused by instability at high temperatures were found in ZnTiO3. Since Pb2+ cation has the appropriate size to occupy the A position in the perovskite structure (1.19 Å), PbTiO3 presents a more symmetrical structure with a closer angle to 180°. On the other hand, Cd and Zn cations with lower ionic radius present structural empty sites, creating a higher number of structural distortions. In the LaBO3 (B: Co, Fe, Mn) family, the cation with the highest ionic radius (Co3+, 2.18 Å) presents the closest angle to 180°, which results in a highly ordered structure. Because the optical properties are closely related to the B cation’s energy levels, the Ti-3d levels are involved in the conduction band. However, the energy levels of Pb3+ are lower than the 3d levels of titanium, so it was possible to observe an optical redshift. On the other hand, LaBO3 materials (B = Co, Mn, Fe) show drastic changes once the B cation is replaced; particularly, Mn and Co cations present absorption in the entire range of the visible spectrum, which is attributed to the presence of lower energy (d→d) transitions. Regarding the H2 production, LaMnO3 and ZnTiO3 show the highest hydrogen production (103μmol g−1 and 130μmol g−1, respectively); such enhanced activity is related to the presence of La2O3 and TiO2 as additional phases. The formation of a ZnTiO3/TiO2 heterostructure improves the charge separation. For LaMnO3, the lanthanide 4f level plays an important role in the interfacial charge transfer; a more symmetrical and defect-free structure improves the load transport onto the material surface. Despite the efficient initial photocatalytic activity, LaBO3 (B: Co, Fe, Mn) materials showed a deactivation process; such feature was attributed to a surface blockage by oxygenated species, particularly CO3-2 and OH−. Since the heterojunction formation improved LaMnO3 and ZnTiO3 performance, two new efficient heterostructures, BaBiO3/NaTaO3 and g-C3N4/LaBO3 (B: Co, Fe, Mn), were synthesized. It was determined the g-C3N4/2%LaFeO3 (type-ll heterostructure) showed the best photocatalytic performance (140μmol g−1). Above 2 wt.% of LaFeO3, the g-C3N4 active sites are blocked, resulting in reduced light absorption, and increased recombination rate. On the other hand, the addition of 20 wt.% BaBiO3 to NaTaO3 improves the absorption of light in the visible range and increases the heterostructure crystallite size, thus promoting a lower number of grain boundary defects, reducing the charge carrier’s recombination rate. Therefore, this chapter aims to present strategies that improve photocatalytic activity by modifying the internal, morphological, and surface structure of active perovskite materials.","meta":{"doi":"803579"},"tokens":[[{"start":62,"end":72,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":74,"end":87,"text":"morphological","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":89,"end":96,"text":"optical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":102,"end":128,"text":"electrochemical parameters","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":161,"end":172,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":216,"end":250,"text":"photocatalytic hydrogen generation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":361,"end":383,"text":"LaBO3 (M = Co, Mn, Fe)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":388,"end":410,"text":"ATiO3 (A = Zn, Cd, Pb)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":428,"end":438,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":480,"end":485,"text":"LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":486,"end":497,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":523,"end":535,"text":"g-C3N4/LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":536,"end":552,"text":"heterostructures","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":575,"end":605,"text":"photoelectrocatalytic activity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":622,"end":635,"text":"BaBiO3/NaTaO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":636,"end":650,"text":"heterojunction","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":778,"end":800,"text":"ATiO3 (A = Zn, Cd, Pb)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":840,"end":846,"text":"CdTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":851,"end":857,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":924,"end":928,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":876,"end":888,"text":"rhombohedral","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":939,"end":950,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":986,"end":992,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1000,"end":1004,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1069,"end":1079,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1100,"end":1106,"text":"PbTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1193,"end":1195,"text":"Cd","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1200,"end":1202,"text":"Zn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1326,"end":1347,"text":"LaBO3 (B: Co, Fe, Mn)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1505,"end":1523,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1661,"end":1665,"text":"Pb3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1698,"end":1706,"text":"titanium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1614,"end":1629,"text":"conduction band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1778,"end":1810,"text":"LaBO3 materials (B = Co, Mn, Fe)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1877,"end":1879,"text":"Mn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1884,"end":1886,"text":"Co","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2044,"end":2046,"text":"H2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2059,"end":2065,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2070,"end":2076,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2212,"end":2217,"text":"La2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2222,"end":2226,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2268,"end":2279,"text":"ZnTiO3/TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2280,"end":2295,"text":"heterostructure","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":2332,"end":2338,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2579,"end":2600,"text":"LaBO3 (B: Co, Fe, Mn)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2554,"end":2577,"text":"photocatalytic activity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2787,"end":2793,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2798,"end":2804,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2836,"end":2852,"text":"heterostructures","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":2854,"end":2867,"text":"BaBiO3/NaTaO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2872,"end":2900,"text":"g-C3N4/LaBO3 (B: Co, Fe, Mn)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2942,"end":2957,"text":"g-C3N4/2%LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2967,"end":2982,"text":"heterostructure","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":3000,"end":3026,"text":"photocatalytic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":3058,"end":3064,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":3070,"end":3076,"text":"g-C3N4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":3219,"end":3225,"text":"BaBiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":3229,"end":3235,"text":"NaTaO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":3308,"end":3323,"text":"heterostructure","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":3513,"end":3536,"text":"photocatalytic activity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":3611,"end":3622,"text":"perovskite ","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":678,"created_at":"2023-03-06T06:26:19.894499Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T06:26:19.894499Z","lead_time":340.982}

{"text":"Nowdays, where the pollution is increasing with the increase of the world’s population and the demand of power is growing drastically. With various types of the recently popping types of renewable energies, the major fact for each research team working in the energy field is the concern of power efficiency. Efficiency for electric sources may be improved by utilizing nanomaterials as alternative to commonly used expensive catalysts similar to platinum black. These nanomaterials are used to increase the efficiency for power production in fuel cells. In this chapter, a unique class of mixed oxide nanomaterials, known as perovskites, will explored. Perovskites, which have the general formula ABO3 where A is an alkali, an alkaline earth metal, or a lanthanide and B is a transition metal, can be prepared through simple chemical methods similar to coprecipitation, combustion, or microwave-assisted methodologies. With the emergence of these nanocatalysts that both are cost-effective and have high catalytic activities, perovskites have been successively applied as nanocatalysts for fuel cell reactions, such as methanol oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and many other reactions.

{"text":"Lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are suitable as the emissive layers in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The external quantum efficiency of green LEDs based on LHPs is now over 20%. Nevertheless, the blue LHP LEDs lag behind the green ones in terms of efficiency. Photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) and stability of the NCs under various operating conditions are two major factors that influence the LED performance. Therefore, to promote the efforts towards achieving improved LED efficiencies, herein, we summarize several synthetic methods that produce blue-emitting LHP NC, followed by several approaches devised to boost their PL QYs up to near unity. Light-induced anion segregation is one of the limitations of using blue-emitting mixed-halide LHPs, which triggers the attention to single halide, quantum-confined LHP nanoplatelets (NPLs). Syntheses, structure, and luminescent properties of organic–inorganic and all-inorganic blue-emitting LHP NPLs are discussed elaborately. In the last portion, the luminescent properties of lead-free metal halides, which are of current interest, are discussed, followed by an outlook and future directions. In conclusion, our review discusses various literature attempts to obtain stable blue-emitting LHP NCs, which can be helpful in a better design of the blue-emitting LHP NCs towards various light-emitting applications.","meta":{"doi":"803567"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":23,"text":"Lead halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":25,"end":29,"text":"LHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":70,"end":91,"text":"light-emitting diodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":93,"end":97,"text":"LEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":135,"end":145,"text":"green LEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":104,"end":131,"text":"external quantum efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":200,"end":203,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":204,"end":208,"text":"LEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":259,"end":300,"text":"Photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY)","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":305,"end":314,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":322,"end":325,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":402,"end":405,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":480,"end":483,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":572,"end":575,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":576,"end":578,"text":"NC","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":634,"end":640,"text":"PL QYs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":753,"end":757,"text":"LHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":823,"end":826,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":827,"end":840,"text":"nanoplatelets","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":842,"end":846,"text":"NPLs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":951,"end":954,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":955,"end":959,"text":"NPLs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":875,"end":897,"text":"luminescent properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1012,"end":1034,"text":"luminescent properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1250,"end":1253,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1254,"end":1257,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1320,"end":1323,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1324,"end":1327,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":666,"created_at":"2023-03-06T02:41:03.820973Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T02:41:03.820973Z","lead_time":1281.245}

{"text":"Nanostructured carbon allotropes have gained much attention in the scientific community due to their vast applications in various fields. The carbon nanomaterials can be found in form of various different hybridization states and each of them having unique electronic properties. The reduced dimensionalities with sp2 bonded graphitic carbon form a highly delocalized electronic state, suggesting their applicability as high mobility electronic materials. Additionally, the tunable optical band gap makes them promising materials for optoelectronic device applications. Recently, carbon nanomaterials such as zero-dimensional fullerenes, one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and two-dimensional graphene and their derivatives have been widely investigated for the latest generation photovoltaic and optoelectronic device applications because of their chemical stability, mechanical stability, and exceptional optoelectronic properties. For example, fullerene derivatives are widely used as acceptor materials for efficient bulk heterojunction solar cells because of their ability to well-diffuse into the semiconducting polymer films and to form an intermixed layer with desired morphology, while these are used as electron transport/injection layer for perovskite solar cells and light-emitting diodes. CNTs and graphene show promise as transparent conducting electrodes for flexible and lightweight organic and perovskite optoelectronic devices. In addition, CNTs are gaining popularity as active layer components of photovoltaic devices owing to their higher aspect ratio and electrical conductivity. Furthermore, graphene oxide has also been used in the active layer of organic solar cells for efficient charge separation and charge transport owing to their large acceptor/donor interface area and continuous pathway. Recently, graphene oxide (GO) is used as a buffer layer in organic and perovskite optoelectronic devices. Specifically, GO and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) composite has been used as hole transport layer for improving the stability and efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells.

{"text":"Two-dimensional (2D) covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with periodic functional n-electron systems are an emerging class of optoelectronic materials. However, almost all conjugated COFs so far are insoluble and hard to process, which hampers severely their optoelectronic applications. Here, a solution-processable, nanoscale and sp2 carbon-conjugated COF-like material, PDPP-C20 was successfully designed and synthesized. The solution-processed PDPP-C20 films exhibit high crystallinity and excellent charge transport properties along out-of-plane directions, combined with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of −5.36/−3.75 eV, making PDPP-C20 suitable for electronic device applications. An efficiency as high as 21.92% has been demonstrated when it was used as a functional interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells, coupled with dramatically improved stability in comparison with the control device due to the superior hydrophobicity of PDPP-C20 layer as well as its passivation effect on perovskite surface. Furthermore, the soluble PDPP-C20 could also be used as donor in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells and an initial efficiency of 2.46% has been achieved. These results indicate that this new class of soluble and nanoscale COF-like materials should offer a new arena of functional materials for optoelectronic devices.","meta":{"doi":"803563"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"Two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":17,"end":19,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":21,"end":48,"text":"covalent organic frameworks","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":50,"end":54,"text":"COFs","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":125,"end":149,"text":"optoelectronic materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":182,"end":186,"text":"COFs","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":353,"end":356,"text":"COF","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":372,"end":380,"text":"PDPP-C20","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":428,"end":446,"text":"solution-processed","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":447,"end":455,"text":"PDPP-C20","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":456,"end":461,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":503,"end":530,"text":"charge transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":698,"end":706,"text":"PDPP-C20","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":860,"end":882,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":919,"end":928,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1005,"end":1013,"text":"PDPP-C20","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1057,"end":1067,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1035,"end":1053,"text":"passivation effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1102,"end":1110,"text":"PDPP-C20","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1142,"end":1181,"text":"bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1304,"end":1307,"text":"COF","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1376,"end":1398,"text":"optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":662,"created_at":"2023-03-05T11:26:57.238777Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T11:26:57.238777Z","lead_time":3660.144}
{"text":"As no complete and comprehensive studies have been previously reported for La-doped nanocrystalline SrZrO3 (SZO), we researched herein a detailed investigation for pure and La-doped samples. A modified solid-state reaction process, including successive cycles of milling and sintering at high temperature, was followed to produce SZO and Sr0.9La0.1ZrO3 (SLZO) powdered ingots. Rietveld analysis of X-ray diffractometer data predicts that the two samples exhibit orthorhombic structure with an increase in crystallite size by ~25% for doped sample. A great reduction in Raman modes intensity (~60%) and an annihilation of several vibration modes were detected using Raman spectroscopy. The degree of ordering on the B-site was recorded to be higher in La-doped sample. According to ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption, a decrease in the optical gap width (Eg) from 4.40 eV to 4.21 eV was achieved by La incorporation due to the presence of additional defect states such as oxygen and Sr vacancies at the band edge. The process of electron–hole recombination was studied using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Deconvolution of PL spectra yielded four emission bands: one green band, one blue band, and two violet bands. Highly intense violet emission at λ = 393 nm approximately five times greater than that detected for pure SZO is realized as La3+ substitutes for Sr2+. Such property nominates SLZO for technological applications requiring highly intense violet emission, e.g., light-emitting diodes.","meta":{"doi":"803562"},"tokens":[[{"start":75,"end":77,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":78,"end":83,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":84,"end":99,"text":"nanocrystalline","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":100,"end":106,"text":"SrZrO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":108,"end":111,"text":"SZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":173,"end":175,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":176,"end":181,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":202,"end":222,"text":"solid-state reaction","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":330,"end":333,"text":"SZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":338,"end":352,"text":"Sr0.9La0.1ZrO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":354,"end":358,"text":"SLZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":398,"end":418,"text":"X-ray diffractometer","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":462,"end":474,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":505,"end":521,"text":"crystallite size","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":665,"end":683,"text":"Raman spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":751,"end":753,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":754,"end":759,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":781,"end":820,"text":"ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":903,"end":905,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":987,"end":989,"text":"Sr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":976,"end":982,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1033,"end":1060,"text":"electron–hole recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1079,"end":1114,"text":"photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1332,"end":1335,"text":"SZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1351,"end":1355,"text":"La3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1372,"end":1376,"text":"Sr2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1402,"end":1406,"text":"SLZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1486,"end":1507,"text":"light-emitting diodes","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":661,"created_at":"2023-03-05T10:25:56.078291Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T10:25:56.078291Z","lead_time":6635.276}

In this work, we summarized several representative halide perovskite-based FETs including thin-films, single crystals and mixed function layers. First, the perovskite films that can exhibit field-effect characteristics at low or normal temperature were introduced.

{"text":"The demand for fossil fuel consumption is continuously increasing due to the growth of the world’s population. Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emission from conventional energy sources eventually will amplify the Earth’s natural “greenhouse” effect and hence will result in global warming. Therefore, to reduce the risk of climate change, photovoltaic solar cell (PV) devices have been developed. Surprisingly, PV system has capability to conduct useful electricity from natural sunlight source, which provides clean, sustainable, and renewable energy instead of combusted conventional fossil fuel sources. Nowadays, both dye-sensitized cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were investigated more intensively than the first- and second-generation solar cell systems due to their flexibility, transparency, and lighter weight materials. In fact, photoanode elements played an essential role in determining the strength of light-harvesting absorption and generating excited electron charge carriers’ mobility between dye/perovskite and respective transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glasses. Apart from that, binary/ternary transition metal oxide material selection (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, MgO, WO3, etc.) of photoanode in DSSCs and PSCs is also a crucial factor for photogenerated electrons. However, still metal oxide materials have some drawbacks such as high recombination rate which resulted in losses of overall photoenergy conversion efficiency (PCE) performance. In fact, the PCE of existing either DSSC or PSC devices still have rooms to improve compared to first- and second-generation solar cells. This chapter briefly discussed the operational principle, material selection, key problems, and also the insight to commercialization of organic PV devices.","meta":{"doi":"803559"},"tokens":[[{"start":111,"end":125,"text":"Carbon dioxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":127,"end":130,"text":"CO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":331,"end":355,"text":" photovoltaic solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":357,"end":359,"text":"PV","annotation":"APL"},{"start":404,"end":406,"text":"PV","annotation":"APL"},{"start":615,"end":635,"text":"dye-sensitized cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":637,"end":642,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":672,"end":676,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":648,"end":670,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":751,"end":761,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1023,"end":1033,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1168,"end":1172,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1174,"end":1177,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1179,"end":1183,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1185,"end":1188,"text":"MgO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1190,"end":1193,"text":"WO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1218,"end":1223,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1228,"end":1232,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1413,"end":1446,"text":"photoenergy conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1448,"end":1451,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1479,"end":1482,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1502,"end":1506,"text":"DSSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1510,"end":1513,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1591,"end":1602,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1741,"end":1759,"text":"organic PV devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":658,"created_at":"2023-03-04T14:51:11.523598Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T14:51:11.523598Z","lead_time":2252.44}

{"text":"Developing dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has been a very active research topic in recent years since HTMs play a critical role in optimizing interfacial charge carrier kinetics and in turn determining device performance. Here, a novel dendritic engineering strategy is first utilized to design HTMs with a D-A type molecular framework, and diphenylamine and/or carbazole is selected as the building block for constructing dendrons. All HTMs show good thermal stability and excellent film morphology, and the key optoelectronic properties could be fine-tuned by varying the dendron structure. Among them, MPA-Cz-BTI and MCz-Cz-BTI exhibit an improved interfacial contact with the perovskite active layer, and non-radiative recombination loss and charge transport loss can be effectively suppressed. Consequently, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.8% and 21.35% are achieved for MPA-Cz-BTI and MCz-Cz-BTI based devices, respectively, accompanied by excellent long-term storage stability. More encouragingly, ultrahigh fill factors of 85.2% and 83.5% are recorded for both devices, which are among the highest values reported to date. This work demonstrates the great potential of dendritic materials as a new type of dopant-free HTMs for high-performance PVSCs with excellent FF.","meta":{"doi":"803553"},"tokens":[[{"start":23,"end":50,"text":"hole-transporting materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":52,"end":56,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":79,"end":101,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":103,"end":108,"text":"PVSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":170,"end":174,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":363,"end":367,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":505,"end":509,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":581,"end":606,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":748,"end":758,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":759,"end":771,"text":"active layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":886,"end":915,"text":"power conversion efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":917,"end":921,"text":"PCEs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1058,"end":1067,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1310,"end":1314,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1336,"end":1341,"text":"PVSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1099,"end":1111,"text":"fill factors","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1357,"end":1359,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":652,"created_at":"2023-03-04T12:56:06.020900Z","updated_at":"2023-03-04T12:56:06.020900Z","lead_time":848.473}
{"text":"In this chapter, theoretical calculations for perovskite solar cell materials are illustrated using the method of the first-principles calculations. The perovskite solar cell materials undergo phase transition under high pressure. The fine three-dimensional structure is also altered through doping of metals or metal salts, surface adsorption of these metals or metal salts, usually at the air/surface interface. These perovskite structures have applications in use as solar cells, and the various likely structures and associated energies were modelled and studies using computational methods. We established some relatively sophisticated interfacial atomistic models for perovskite solar cells and reveal the micromechanism of photoelectric properties affected by the interfaces (structures and properties). We used the first-principles calculation to systematically study the local lattice structures and photoelectronic properties of the interfaces located in electron transfer material | CH3NH3PbI3 light-absorbing layer | hole transfer material | metal electrode at electronic and atomic levels. For the local lattice structures, lattice direction match, lattice mismatch, the chemical composition in the adjacent layers, bond lengths, bond angles, and lattice defects have been considered. For the photoelectric properties, complex dielectric function, absorption coefficient, energy band alignment, interface states, and their density of states have been calculated. Our research aims to construct the interface models and doping mechanism and to “deeply understand the relationship among the local latti0ce structures of the interfaces, interface properties, and perovskite solar cell’s performances. As theoretical guides, quantitative results at an electronic/atomistic scale will be helpful to design chemical components of the cell’s materials and those at the interfaces, to passivate the surface and interface states, to modify the interface structures, to manipulate the interface properties, to take advantage of the so-called interface engineering, and then to improve the performance of the solar cell” (First Principles Simulations for CuInGaSe2 (CIGS) Solar Cells.

{"text":"Fullerenes are among the most widely used n-type organic semiconducting materials and have been extensively investigated in a variety of applications. Fullerene materials have frequently been used in photovoltaic applications thanks to their excellent electrical properties, which include ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer and low reorganization energy. Accordingly, fullerene materials provide superior performance in both organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) despite playing different roles in these two types of cells. To date, fullerene organic photovoltaics have achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 21.3%, up from the PCE of 3.2% reported for the first fullerene derivative photovoltaics in 1995. In OSCs, fullerenes are used as electron acceptors and are mixed with an electron donor to fabricate the active layer of the device. Consequently, the energy level and molecular packing of fullerenes are major concerns and frequent subjects of investigation. In PSCs, on the other hand, a perovskite-structured compound is required in the active layer, so fullerenes are used as electron transport materials or dopants rather than as electron acceptors. For these roles in PSCs, attention shifted to electron carrier mobility, interlayer morphology, and passivation effects.

O2, CO and CH4 are the observed gaseous products during the reaction and there is FTIR evidence for the formation of adsorbed alcohols and carbonylated products. Although the modification with amine groups decreased the overall photocatalytic reactivity, it also altered the product selectivity with respect to the CH4/CO ratio.

{"text":"The photovoltaic (PV) industry is attracting a lot of attention from researchers and industry alike. The conventional sources of energy pose a threat to the environment and are depleting at a rapid pace. Sooner or later, these sources need to be replaced with dependable and cleaner sources. The quest to develop solar cells with high efficiency and low cost is afoot. The first-generation solar cells achieved high efficiency but at a high manufacturing cost. The -generation solar cells had phenomenal success in balancing performance and cost but employed toxic materials. Third-generation solar cells such as perovskite solar cells have not only achieved high efficiency but have also overcome the shortcomings of previous generations. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) consist of light-absorbing organic metal halides sandwiched between charge transport layers. The function of transport layers is to separate and transport the charges effectively. Metal oxides, due to their high chemical stability, easy processability and low cost, are most suitable as transport layers. Depending upon nature and band positions, the metal oxides can be used either as an electron or as a hole transport layer.

{"text":"In recent years, lead-halide perovskite (LHP) have made tremendous progress in photovoltaic and optoelectronic fields. However, stability and toxicity still are obstacles for commercial application. These challenges have motivated significant efforts to search nontoxic and stable alternatives which could achieve comparable high performance with low-cost and facile fabrication methods. With continuing increasing computation powers, first-principles modeling combining with machine learning (ML) has made significant advances in the discovery of new perovskite materials. This provides invaluable insights into the physical origin for the high performance of perovskites in photovoltaic field, thereby facilitating the discovery of good absorber perovskite materials. This chapter aims to give a brief review of ML-guided design and discovery of perovskite materials for photovoltaics. Specifically, this chapter will introduce well-established ML models widely used in perovskite-related studies from both the construction of data and material representation aspects. The approaches of data sets will be discussed including the high-throughput (HT) computations and experimentations. The material representation will cover descriptors and feature engineering of perovskites in photovoltaic field. Then, we will give a general introduction of recent progress for ML models applications in perovskite solar cells. Conclusion and outlook will be given in the end.","meta":{"doi":"803544"},"tokens":[[{"start":17,"end":39,"text":"lead-halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":41,"end":44,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":128,"end":137,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":142,"end":150,"text":"toxicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":435,"end":470,"text":"first-principles modeling combining","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":476,"end":493,"text":"machine learning ","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":552,"end":562,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":494,"end":496,"text":"ML","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":661,"end":672,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":748,"end":758,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":848,"end":858,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":814,"end":816,"text":"ML","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":873,"end":886,"text":"photovoltaics","annotation":"APL"},{"start":947,"end":949,"text":"ML","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":972,"end":982,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1265,"end":1276,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1365,"end":1367,"text":"ML","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1391,"end":1413,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":643,"created_at":"2023-03-03T13:23:18.411829Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T13:23:18.411829Z","lead_time":164.704}

{"text":"Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramic membrane has rapidly become an attractive alternative technology to conventional pressure swing adsorption and cryogenic distillation for oxygen separation from air. Given the heat integration opportunity in most energy generation processes, this technology offers lower cost and energy penalty given its capability to produce pure oxygen at high temperature (>800 °C). The integration of dense MIEC membranes in oxyfuel combustion to supply an oxygen-rich feed stream in turn facilitates the production of concentrated carbon dioxide gas downstream, which can be easily captured and handled to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect. This chapter overviews and discusses all essential aspects to understand oxygen-selective MIEC ceramic membrane technology. The basics behind the formation of defects responsible for high-temperature ionic transport are explained together with the transport theory. Two major family structures, e.g., fluorite and perovskite, which become the building blocks of most MIEC materials are discussed. Specific structure and properties as well as the advantages and the drawbacks of each family are explained. Some important structural considerations, e.g., crystal structure packing and Goldschmidt tolerance factor, are elaborated due to their strong relationship with the properties. Two additional concepts, e.g., dual-phase membrane and external short circuit, are given to address the drawbacks associated with fluorite and perovskite MIEC materials. Various geometries and types of MIEC membranes can be prepared, e.g., disk, tube, hollow fiber with single or multiple channels, or flat plate, each of which fits particular application. MIEC membranes can be coupled with other applications to facilitate specific reactions to synthesize value-added products. Several oxygen permeation models and their applicability to different membranes are briefly highlighted. Finally, an overview on the future prospects of oxygen-permeable MIEC membranes is provided.","meta":{"doi":"803539"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":57,"text":"Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramic membrane","annotation":"APL"},{"start":381,"end":387,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":444,"end":458,"text":"MIEC membranes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":569,"end":583,"text":"carbon dioxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":770,"end":791,"text":"MIEC ceramic membrane","annotation":"APL"},{"start":994,"end":1004,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":981,"end":989,"text":"fluorite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1047,"end":1061,"text":"MIEC materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1492,"end":1500,"text":"fluorite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1505,"end":1515,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1516,"end":1530,"text":"MIEC materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1564,"end":1578,"text":"MIEC membranes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1719,"end":1733,"text":"MIEC membranes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":2012,"end":2026,"text":"MIEC membranes","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":638,"created_at":"2023-03-03T10:39:50.135607Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T10:39:50.135607Z","lead_time":8712.439}

A flexible, sensitive, and self-powered pressure sensor was developed by integrating a mechanoluminescent device with a light-absorbing layer of the perovskite material. Understanding the behavior of the device as an embedded sensor is necessary for its application in continuous in-situ SHM of multifunctional composite materials.

In this work, two sulfonyldibenzene-based molecules, named CS-04 and CS-05, are synthesized and employed as HTMs in n-i-p PSCs. In comparison with CS-04, the carbazole-substituted methoxytriphenylamine (CzMOTPA) group in CS-05 exhibits an increased degree of molecular distortion, thus endowing CS-05 with excellent solvent solubility and film-formation ability. Moreover, CS-05 shows a high hole mobility, superior hole extraction and hole transporting properties. As a result, CS-05 yields impressive device performances with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.15%, while that of CS-04 based device is 19.50%, which is comparable to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD based control device (19.59%).

{"text":"Carbon dioxide reforming of methane reaction (DRM) is an important process to produce synthesis gas at low H2/CO ratio and to consume the two main greenhouse gases CH4 and CO2. Nickel-based catalysts are the most frequently used in dry reforming of methane. However, deactivation of these catalysts is a major problem due to carbon deposition and metal sintering. In order to minimize the deactivation phenomena of the nickel-based catalysts, a great attention is given to the use of the perovskite oxide (ABO3) catalysts. These oxides have a defined structure that yields small metallic particles highly active and quite stable during DRM reaction. This work deals dry reforming of methane to produce synthesis gas (H2/CO), using the mixed oxides LaNi1-xZnxO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.8 and 1) perovskite-type catalysts. The auto-combustion using glycine as ignition promoter was the method for the synthesis of these catalysts, and then, they were characterized by using XRD, FTIR, and N2 physisorption. XRD analysis of the solids LaNi1-xZnxO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.8) shows the formation of perovskite structure at 2θ between 32° and 33°. At high Zn content (x = 1), the catalyst showed the presence of individual metal oxides ZnO and La2O3. These oxides are confirmed by FTIR characterization with observation of bands in the range 450–700 cm−1which are attributed to M–O-M of the perovskite structure and M–O of the simple oxide. The effect of partial substitution of Ni by Zn on the catalytic performance has been studied. LaNi0.8Zn0.2O3 was the most active toward the CH4 and CO2 conversions and was selective for synthesis gas products at 750 °C. This activity was attributed to high dispersion of the small metallic nickel particles (19 nm) and the high surface area (27 m2/g).","meta":{"doi":"803531"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":44,"text":"Carbon dioxide reforming of methane reaction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":46,"end":49,"text":"DRM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":107,"end":109,"text":"H2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":110,"end":112,"text":"CO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":164,"end":167,"text":"CH4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":172,"end":175,"text":"CO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":177,"end":183,"text":"Nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":184,"end":189,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":190,"end":199,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":289,"end":298,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":488,"end":498,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":512,"end":521,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":419,"end":425,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":426,"end":431,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":432,"end":441,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":636,"end":639,"text":"DRM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":717,"end":719,"text":"H2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":720,"end":722,"text":"CO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":748,"end":784,"text":"LaNi1-xZnxO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.8 and 1)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":785,"end":795,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":801,"end":810,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":909,"end":918,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":963,"end":966,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":968,"end":972,"text":"FTIR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":996,"end":999,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":978,"end":994,"text":"N2 physisorption","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1023,"end":1053,"text":"LaNi1-xZnxO3 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.8)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1077,"end":1087,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1133,"end":1135,"text":"Zn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1157,"end":1165,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1213,"end":1216,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1221,"end":1226,"text":"La2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1258,"end":1262,"text":"FTIR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1456,"end":1458,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1462,"end":1464,"text":"Zn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1512,"end":1526,"text":"LaNi0.8Zn0.2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1558,"end":1561,"text":"CH4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1566,"end":1569,"text":"CO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1708,"end":1714,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1715,"end":1724,"text":"particles","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":630,"created_at":"2023-03-03T07:41:18.146753Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T07:41:18.146753Z","lead_time":248.095}

The elastic constants for the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 hydride are successfully obtained from the stress-strain relationship calculations. The obtained equilibrium lattice parameters and elastic constant (Cij) are in good agreement with other theoretical values and experimental data available in the literature.

The effect of cobalt content on physico-chemical properties of LaFeO3 perovskite was studied by means of XRD, FTIR and N2 physisorption. XRD analyses revealed that a stable perovskite with orthorhombic structure up to x = 0.4 was obtained, whereas for higher cobalt content, the rhombohedral structure was formed. Furthermore, the partial replacement of Fe(III) with Co (III) cations restrained the growth of the large crystallites of LaFeO3 (~74 nm). In the FTIR spectra, the shift of Fe–O bonds position toward higher frequencies proved the incorporation of cobalt in the perovskite structure. BET surface area values were found to be between 7 and 17 m2/g. Through the catalytic tests results, the lowest substituted catalyst exhibited a higher activity than pure LaFeO3 while further increase of cobalt content led to a remarkable decrease in the performance of the catalyst. All catalysts converted styrene to Benzaldehyde selectively.

{"text":"Weak light imaging has drawn more and more attention because of its promising potential for practical applications in security monitoring and space exploration. In this work, all-inorganic Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite-based self-powered photodetectors containing inorganic copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) as hole-transport layers (HTLs) are successfully fabricated and applied for weak light imaging, which is the first report on the weak light imaging application of all-inorganic lead-free perovskite photodetectors. CuSCN films with favorable optical property and hole extraction capability are prepared via a cost efficient and fast solvent removal method, demonstrating the potential for high-performance perovskite-based devices as transparent components. It is revealed that the band alignment of the device is effectively optimized with the presence of CuSCN HTLs, which can availably transport holes while block electrons at the Cs2AgBiBr6/CuSCN interface, resulting in remarkable improvement of photoresponse performance. The responsivity and detectivity are 0.34 A W−1 and 1.03×1013 Jones, respectively. In particular, the light current has a boost of almost 10 times. Furthermore, the photodetectors are integrated into a self built light detection imaging system uti lizing the focused laser scanning imaging mode. With illumination of as low as 5 nW cm−2 (405 nm), the image involving graphics and words with a size of 5 cm×5 cm can still be distinctly recognized.

{"text":"In this work, to probe the charge transfer mechanism of methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3), we have used density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We investigate ground and excited states optimized geometry, UV-vis spectrum and vibrational frequencies of CH3NH3PbI3 molecule. It is observed that in an excited state, the structural change is mostly localized in PbI3 part of the molecule. Mulliken charge analysis shows that lead (Pb) atom acquires a maximum positive charge and all iodine atoms get a negative charge. In addition to this, all the hydrogen atoms donate their charge to iodine atoms. Therefore, electron transfer from lead (Pb) and hydrogen atoms to the iodine atoms can be considered as a significant charge transfer mechanism. Vibrational frequencies are obtained and assigned with the help of hessian calculations.

To find solutions to improve the performance of solar panels and the efficiency of their absorption, this research examined the effects of using nanostructures and plasmonic nanoparticles for modification of perovskite solar cells' active layer to create a wider absorption spectrum. For this purpose, the effects of different factors, such as the composition, radius and location of plasmonic nanoparticles on light absorption, open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiency (PCE), were considered. Silver spherical nanoparticles were selected to be placed in the absorbent layer because of their low loss and high absorption power.

The POSS-PQDs-Apt can be adsorbed on the MXenes nanosheets, and its fluorescence was quenched due to the FRET. After the composite probes were incubated with VP for 50 min, the POSS-PQDs-Apt binding with VP can be released from the surface of MXenes, and the signal recovered due to its higher affinity to the VP than MXenes. The fluorescence intensity from 519 nm emission of the system was measured at 480 nm excitation. Under In optimized conditions, the assay can determine VP in the concentration range 102 - 106 cfu/mL, and the detection limit (LOD) was 30 cfu/mL using fluorescence detection. The LOD is still 100 cfu/mL by naked eye detection which is proper for on-line monitoring VP in aquaculture water.

{"text":"The electric conductivity and dielectric properties of polycrystalline La0.53Ca0.47Mn0.5Cr0.5O3 are studied with impedance spectroscopy techniques over a wide range of frequencies and temperatures from 100 to 1 MHz and 100 and to 400 K, respectively. The material exhibits a semiconductor behavior in the whole temperature range, characterized by a change in the slope at a specific temperature with a saturation at ~ 360 K. At low temperature, the conduction mechanism is governed by distributed trap localized charge carrier states described by a variable-range hopping model. At high temperature, the conduction mechanism is thermally activated by a small polaron hopping process. At low frequencies, the high dielectric constants of the material decrease rapidly with frequency and increase with temperature due to the free charges accumulated at the electrode-sample interface (interfacial Maxwell–Wagner polarization). These high dielectric constants can be interpreted by the existence of grain boundaries. Additionally, the Nyquist plots are presented by two depressed not centered semicircles on the real axis, indicating non-Debye behavior for the material. The resistance of the grain boundaries is larger than the resistance of the grains, confirming that the grain boundaries govern the conductivity in La0.53Ca0.47Mn0.5Cr0.5O3. Finally, the modulus analysis indicates a transition of carrier mobility from the long range in the low-frequency region to the short range in the high-frequency region.","meta":{"doi":"803495"},"tokens":[[{"start":4,"end":25,"text":"electric conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":30,"end":51,"text":"dielectric properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":55,"end":70,"text":"polycrystalline","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":71,"end":95,"text":"La0.53Ca0.47Mn0.5Cr0.5O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":113,"end":146,"text":"impedance spectroscopy techniques","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":275,"end":288,"text":"semiconductor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":512,"end":527,"text":"charge carrier ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":713,"end":733,"text":"dielectric constants","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":936,"end":956,"text":"dielectric constants","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":996,"end":1012,"text":"grain boundaries","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1032,"end":1045,"text":"Nyquist plots","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1190,"end":1206,"text":"grain boundaries","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1272,"end":1288,"text":"grain boundaries","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1316,"end":1340,"text":"La0.53Ca0.47Mn0.5Cr0.5O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1398,"end":1414,"text":"carrier mobility","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":596,"created_at":"2023-03-01T11:46:59.953912Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T11:46:59.953912Z","lead_time":4243.805}

{"text":"Lewis-base polymers have been widely utilized as additives to act as a template for the perovskite nucleation/crystal growth and passivate the under-coordinated Pb2+ sites. However, it is uncovered in this work that the polymer on the perovskite grain boundaries would significantly hinder the charge transport due to its low conductivity, which brings about free carrier recombination and photocurrent losses. To circumvent this issue while fully exploiting the benefits of polymers in passivating the trap states in perovskite, we incorporate highly conductive multiwall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with Lewis-base polymers as co-additives in the perovskite film. Functionalizing the CNTs with -COOH group enables a selective hole-extraction and charge transport from perovskite to the hole transporting materials (HTM). By studying the charge transporting and recombination dynamics, we revealed the individual role of the polymer and CNTs in passivating the trap states and facilitating the charge transport, respectively. As a result, the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with polymer-CNTs composites exhibit an impressive PCE of 21.7% for a small-area device (0.16 cm2) and 20.7% for a large-area device (1.0 cm2). Moreover, due to the superior mechanical flexibility of both polymer and CNTs, the polymer-CNTs composites incorporation in the perovskite film encourages the fabrication of flexible PSCs (f-PSCs) with an impressive PCE of 18.3%, and a strong mechanical durability by retaining 80% of the initial PCE after 1,000 times bending. In addition, we proved that the selection criteria of the polymers can be extended to other long-chain Lewis-base polymers, which opens new possibilities in design and synthesis of inexpensive material for this tactic towards the fabrication of high performance large-area PSCs and f-PSCs.","meta":{"doi":"803493"},"tokens":[[{"start":88,"end":99,"text":"perovskite ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":161,"end":165,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":49,"end":58,"text":"additives","annotation":"APL"},{"start":0,"end":19,"text":"Lewis-base polymers","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":235,"end":245,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":294,"end":310,"text":"charge transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":326,"end":338,"text":"conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":359,"end":385,"text":"free carrier recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":390,"end":409,"text":"photocurrent losses","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":518,"end":528,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":573,"end":589,"text":"carbon nanotubes","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":591,"end":595,"text":"CNTs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":602,"end":621,"text":"Lewis-base polymers","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":625,"end":637,"text":"co-additives","annotation":"APL"},{"start":645,"end":656,"text":"perovskite ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":682,"end":686,"text":"CNTs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":766,"end":776,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":784,"end":811,"text":"hole transporting materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":813,"end":816,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":934,"end":938,"text":"CNTs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1040,"end":1062,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1064,"end":1068,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1121,"end":1124,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1075,"end":1087,"text":"polymer-CNTs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1287,"end":1291,"text":"CNTs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1297,"end":1309,"text":"polymer-CNTs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1310,"end":1320,"text":"composites","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1088,"end":1098,"text":"composites","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1397,"end":1401,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1430,"end":1433,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1511,"end":1514,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1405,"end":1409,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1645,"end":1664,"text":"Lewis-base polymers","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1815,"end":1819,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1826,"end":1830,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":594,"created_at":"2023-03-01T08:40:42.975473Z","updated_at":"2023-03-01T08:40:42.975473Z","lead_time":780.074}

{"text":"As a lead-free perovskite, CsBi3I10 has attracted significant attention because of its high thermal tolerance and long electron diffusion length. Solution-processed high-performance CsBi3I10 perovskite devices, however, are hindered by the formation of a two-dimensional structure, which results in an extremely high surface roughness and many pinholes. In this paper, we reported a space-confined growth (SCG) method using a single-layer polystyrene (PS) sphere template to obtain high-smoothness, high-crystallinity, and dense CsBi3I10 perovskite films. Compared with traditionally spin-coated CsBi3I10 photodetectors (PDs), the metal-semiconductor-metal PDs made by SCG showed a higher photocurrent, a lower dark current, and a bigger on/off ratio. In addition, the photocurrent of our unencapsulated CsBi3I10 perovskite PDs was not attenuated under long-time illumination.

Furthermore, the synthesis was free of antisolvents, such as chlorobenzene and toluene, which is beneficial for the environmentally friendly assembly of the devices.

{"text":"The grain boundaries and interface properties in the active layers of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are important factors affecting the performances of the devices. In this work, a simple and fast concomitant annealing process is established by inducing the secondary growth of the grains using the anti-solvent o-dichlorobenzene (o-PhCl2) or chlorobenzene (PhCl) to suppress the volatilization of solvent molecules during the FA0.80MA0.15Cs0.05Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (FA, CH5N2+, formamidine; MA, CH3NH3+, methylamine) film annealing procedure. The effects of anti-solvent molecules on the phase transformation, grain boundary fusion and morphology evolution of perovskite films are systematically investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that anti-solvent molecules can inhibit solvent evaporation in the active layers and promote crystallite dissolution and ordered secondary growth along the surfaces of large grains. That can promote the formation of large grains and the passivation of surface defects, and can be favorable for the separation and transportation of photocarriers in the active layer. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs can be effectively improved, with a PCE of 20.72% being achieved by a secondary growth perovskite film optimized with o-PhCl2. Moreover, the efficiency remains at 85% of its initial value after 2400 h of treatment in a natural indoor environment with a relative humidity of 45±5%.","meta":{"doi":"803490"},"tokens":[[{"start":53,"end":66,"text":"active layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":70,"end":92,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":94,"end":98,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":312,"end":330,"text":"o-dichlorobenzene ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":331,"end":338,"text":"o-PhCl2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":343,"end":356,"text":"chlorobenzene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":358,"end":362,"text":"PhCl","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":427,"end":461,"text":"FA0.80MA0.15Cs0.05Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":463,"end":465,"text":"FA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":467,"end":473,"text":"CH5N2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":475,"end":486,"text":"formamidine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":488,"end":490,"text":"MA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":492,"end":499,"text":"CH3NH3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":501,"end":512,"text":"methylamine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":514,"end":518,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":657,"end":667,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":668,"end":673,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":709,"end":726,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":728,"end":731,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":737,"end":765,"text":"scanning electron microscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":767,"end":770,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":861,"end":874,"text":"active layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1146,"end":1158,"text":"active layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1178,"end":1205,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1207,"end":1210,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1215,"end":1219,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1256,"end":1259,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1338,"end":1345,"text":"o-PhCl2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1307,"end":1317,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1318,"end":1322,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":591,"created_at":"2022-11-24T09:01:14.017209Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T09:01:14.017209Z","lead_time":231.178}

The properties of the bilayer structure were analyzed with steady-state photoluminescence, ultra-violet photoelectron and impedance spectroscopy. The AFpPPI/Spiro-OMeTAD improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) by lowering the quasi-Fermi energy level for holes and reducing the charge recombination, resulting in high Voc (1.14 V in the champion cell) and high fill factor (FF) that lead to high PCE. The addition of AFpPPI layer improves the quality of Spiro-OMeTAD and provides pinhole-free film. Moreover, the stability is improved in controlled temperature and humid conditions.

{"text":"Cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3, X= Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) and their partly Mn2+-substituted QDs (CsPb1−xMnxX3) attract considerable attention owing to their unique photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies. The two types of QDs, having different PL decay dynamics, needed to be further investigated in a form of aggregates to understand their solid-state-induced exciton dynamics in conjunction with their behaviors upon degradation to achieve practical applications of those promising QDs. However, thus far, these QDs have not been sufficiently investigated to obtain deep insights related to the long-term stability of their PL properties as aggregated solid-states. Therefore, in this study, we comparatively examined CsPbX3- and CsPb1−xMnxX3-type QDs stocked for >50 d under dark ambient conditions by using excitation wavelength-dependent PL quantum yield and time-resolved PL spectroscopy. These investigations were performed with powder samples in addition to solutions to determine the influence of the inter-QD interaction of the aged QD aggregates on their radiative decays. It turns out that the Mn2+-substituted QDs exhibited long-lasting PL quantum efficiencies, while the unsubstituted CsPbX3-type QDs exhibited a drastic reduction of their PL efficiencies. And the obtained PL traces were clearly sensitive to the sample status. This is discussed with the possible interaction depending on the size and distance of the QD aggregates.","meta":{"doi":"803488"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":29,"text":"Cesium lead halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":31,"end":51,"text":"CsPbX3, X= Cl, Br, I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":53,"end":65,"text":"quantum dots","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":67,"end":70,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":89,"end":93,"text":"Mn2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":106,"end":109,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":111,"end":123,"text":"CsPb1−xMnxX3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":94,"end":105,"text":"substituted","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":178,"end":213,"text":"photoluminescence (PL) efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":232,"end":235,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":254,"end":256,"text":"PL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":494,"end":497,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":524,"end":527,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":617,"end":626,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":636,"end":649,"text":"PL properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":730,"end":736,"text":"CsPbX3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":742,"end":754,"text":"CsPb1−xMnxX3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":760,"end":763,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":853,"end":869,"text":"PL quantum yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":888,"end":903,"text":"PL spectroscopy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1053,"end":1055,"text":"QD","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1026,"end":1028,"text":"QD","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1116,"end":1120,"text":"Mn2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1121,"end":1132,"text":"substituted","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1133,"end":1136,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1160,"end":1183,"text":"PL quantum efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1209,"end":1215,"text":"CsPbX3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1221,"end":1224,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1264,"end":1279,"text":"PL efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1298,"end":1300,"text":"PL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1443,"end":1445,"text":"QD","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":589,"created_at":"2022-11-24T08:53:28.432078Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T08:53:28.432078Z","lead_time":2573.513}

{"text":"In this paper we have studied the geometrical and material aspects of plasmonic nanoparticles embedded within organic–inorganic halide Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), to achieve higher solar absorbance enhancement. The material choice of the nanoparticle employed within the film is proportional to the enhancement factor the cell. Interestingly, we observe that copper nanoparticles produce similar absorbance like other conventional metals such as gold and silver. With the existing PSCs designs, high production costs serve as a paramount threat to its commercialization. The utilisation of copper could significantly lower this cost without compromising the solar absorbance of the cell. The size and location of the particle within the 200 nm thick perovskite film are also critically analysed to improve the solar absorbance of the designed solar cell. Results portray that the maximum enhancement can be attained with the inclusion of spherical nanoparticles of 70 nm radii, placed at the center of the film. This work also highlights the impact of different morphologies of plasmonic nanoparticles including sphere, cuboid and ellipsoid integrated with the cell. It is further extended to different geometrical orientations of nanoellipsoids naming oblate and prolate. To avoid a red shift in the resonance wavelength occurring due to plasmonic coupling, the dimer formation of these particles is also taken into account. We mark 30 nm as a safe plasmonic distance for two spherical nanoparticles of radii 30 nm embedded within the film to avoid this effect.

However, the practical applications have been limited by the issues derived from Zn anode. As one of serious problems, Zn dendrite growth caused from the uncontrollable Zn deposition is unfavorable. Herein, with the aim to regulate Zn deposition, an artificial solid–electrolyte interface is subtly engineered with a perovskite type material, BaTiO3, which can be polarized, and its polarization could be switched under the external electric field. Resulting from the aligned dipole in BaTiO3 layer, zinc ions could move in order during cycling process. Regulated Zn migration at the anode/electrolyte interface contributes to the even Zn stripping/plating and confined Zn dendrite growth. As a result, the reversible Zn plating/stripping processes for over 2000 h have been achieved at 1 mA cm−2 with capacity of 1 mAh cm−2.

For this purpose, first-principle calculations within the Density Functional Theory method at the B3LYP level are implemented in the CRYSTAL14 code. Structural and thermodynamic analysis indicates that the change in geometry, as well as the Sn-doping process in BST samples, induces structural defects, which govern its electronic structure, generating singular bandgap values attributed to the perturbation of electronic levels in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Moreover, the vibration analysis was helpful to identify how the Sr and Sn doping process along with the A- and B-site of perovskite structure can affect the structural disorder, mainly for the tetragonal phase. Besides, electron density maps showed that the electronic properties were associated with the presence of [AO12] (A=Ba and Sr) and [MO6] (M=Ti and Sn) clusters with distinct bonding character.

{"text":"Magnetism in double perovskite oxides of the formula A2BB'O6 has been a subject of great interest and intensive research in condensed matter physics. In this paper, Ln2CuRuO6 (A = La, Pr) samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction method, and we investigated their structural and magnetic properties. The new double perovskite compound Pr2CuRuO6 stabilizes in the monoclinic P21/n structure with an antisite defect fraction of ~ 3% between Cu and Ru sites. Our structural analysis indicates the severe deformation of Cu-O-Ru bond angle, as La3+ is replaced by the smaller rare earth ion Pr3+. For Pr2CuRuO6, the observed ferromagnetic transition temperature (Tc = 32 K) is higher than that of La2CuRuO6 (Tc = 15 K), which may be possibly associated with the enhanced magnetic interaction due to the distorted Cu-O-Ru bond angle. In addition, the anomalous phenomenon of ZFC susceptibility at low temperature suggests a degree of magnetic frustration and can be attributable to the intrinsic antisite defect in Pr2CuRuO6. The first principle calculations confirm a ferromagnetic Cu-Ru exchange interaction in Pr2CuRuO6, which is different from the antiferromagnetic case for La2CuRuO6.","meta":{"doi":"803477"},"tokens":[[{"start":13,"end":30,"text":"double perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":165,"end":187,"text":"Ln2CuRuO6 (A = La, Pr)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":216,"end":243,"text":"solid-state reaction method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":271,"end":281,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":286,"end":305,"text":"magnetic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":315,"end":332,"text":"double perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":342,"end":351,"text":"Pr2CuRuO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":381,"end":386,"text":"P21/n","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":370,"end":380,"text":"monoclinic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":405,"end":429,"text":"antisite defect fraction","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":446,"end":448,"text":"Cu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":453,"end":455,"text":"Ru","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":523,"end":525,"text":"Cu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":528,"end":530,"text":"Ru","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":526,"end":527,"text":"O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":546,"end":550,"text":"La3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":593,"end":597,"text":"Pr3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":603,"end":612,"text":"Pr2CuRuO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":627,"end":663,"text":"ferromagnetic transition temperature","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":699,"end":708,"text":"La2CuRuO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":815,"end":817,"text":"Cu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":818,"end":819,"text":"O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":820,"end":822,"text":"Ru","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":880,"end":894,"text":"susceptibility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1016,"end":1025,"text":"Pr2CuRuO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":935,"end":955,"text":"magnetic frustration","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":997,"end":1012,"text":"antisite defect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1031,"end":1059,"text":"first principle calculations","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1084,"end":1086,"text":"Cu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1070,"end":1083,"text":"ferromagnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1087,"end":1089,"text":"Ru","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1114,"end":1123,"text":"Pr2CuRuO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1180,"end":1189,"text":"La2CuRuO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1153,"end":1170,"text":"antiferromagnetic","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":578,"created_at":"2022-11-24T07:30:17.152565Z","updated_at":"2022-11-24T07:30:17.152565Z","lead_time":355.734}

{"text":"Two-dimensional lattice defects, including surface and grain boundaries, in various perovskite oxides have garnered considerable attention, as the overall physical properties of the oxides can significantly vary depending on the atomic and electronic structure of the defects. In particular, because Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) planar faults have a unique lattice structure with [AO] monolayers being inserted in an ABO3 perovskite framework, they have attracted considerable attention, resulting in various relevant studies being conducted. This study focuses on the effect of lattice strain on formation of RP faults and on critical thickness in (001) epitaxial LaNiO3 thin-film fabrication through a sol–gel process. Atomic-scale direct observations identifies that a fault-free coherent buffer layer forms during the RP fault generation and its thickness varies depending on the strain exerted from the substrate. When DyScO3, the lattice mismatch of which is the largest, is used as a substrate, the critical thickness of the fault-free buffer layer remarkably reduces to a few unit cells. This work highlights the significance of direct observation to understand the defect formation in perovskite oxides.","meta":{"doi":"803469"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"Two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":16,"end":31,"text":"lattice defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":84,"end":94,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":155,"end":174,"text":"physical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":240,"end":260,"text":"electronic structure","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":300,"end":336,"text":"Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) planar faults","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":351,"end":368,"text":"lattice structure","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":379,"end":389,"text":"monolayers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":416,"end":426,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":604,"end":613,"text":"RP faults","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":659,"end":665,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":666,"end":675,"text":"thin-film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":698,"end":713,"text":"sol–gel process","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":816,"end":824,"text":"RP fault","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":918,"end":924,"text":"DyScO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":930,"end":946,"text":"lattice mismatch","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1188,"end":1198,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":570,"created_at":"2022-11-22T07:42:55.154137Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:42:55.154137Z","lead_time":304.673}

This has been manifested in the form of several theoretical and experimental investigations for a wide range of hybrid perovskite family members, where a perfect amalgamation of profound theoretical understanding with the possible implications of such materials for the energy scavenging is yet to be achieved completely. Several issues including efficiency, stability, and toxicity are required to be addressed from a holistic approach. This paves the way to the foundation of this review, where we have not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of these materials, but also to their possible implications. The presence of lead in the hybrid perovskite material is certainly a matter of concern from the toxicity viewpoint, despite the enhanced efficiency of the photovoltaic devices based on such materials. Therefore, an ongoing quest has been observed in last few years to replace lead, while at the same time, not compromising the efficiency and stability of the devices.

{"text":"The charge selective layer is of significance for the fabrication of emerging photovoltaics, including perovskite-based solar cells. Molecular hole transport materials (HTMs) are being employed as charge transporters, owing to their synthetic molecular flexibility that allows the fine-tuning of their electro-optical properties. Typically, doping of HTMs is essential, but it is a trade-off between long-term durability and device performance. The energetic level of perylenediimides (PDIs) was altered by the position of the substituent. The substituent’s position influences the geometry of the PDI core, which can lose planarity, thus presenting a core twist angle between the two naphthalene subunits to find its application as hole-selective layers for fabrication. We have fabricated perovskite solar cells, with pristine PDI, and it gave a competitive performance. New design protocols for PDIs are required for aligned energetic levels, which will minimize recombination losses in solar cells, favoring a performance enhancement.","meta":{"doi":"802961"},"tokens":[[{"start":78,"end":91,"text":"photovoltaics","annotation":"APL"},{"start":103,"end":131,"text":"perovskite-based solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":302,"end":328,"text":"electro-optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":143,"end":167,"text":"hole transport materials","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":169,"end":173,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":351,"end":355,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":468,"end":484,"text":"perylenediimides","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":486,"end":490,"text":"PDIs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":449,"end":464,"text":"energetic level","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":598,"end":601,"text":"PDI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":685,"end":705,"text":"naphthalene subunits","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":733,"end":754,"text":"hole-selective layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":829,"end":832,"text":"PDI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":898,"end":902,"text":"PDIs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":990,"end":1001,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":928,"end":944,"text":"energetic levels","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":104,"created_at":"2022-10-21T03:05:42.501171Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T03:05:50.941383Z","lead_time":257.44100000000003}
{"text":"In this study, lanthanum copper oxide was synthesized under hydrothermal techniques and characterized for doxycycline degradation. The catalyst exhibited enhanced photocatalytic doxycycline degradation under visible light owing to its compatible bandgap energy (1.7 eV). The XRD data revealed high crystallinity of the material with no noticeable impurities. Three-dimensional microspheres of varying sizes (average diameter of 2.52 μm) were observed from SEM. EDX confirms the successful synthesis of La2CuO4. The effect of DC concentration, catalyst dosage, and initial pH on the degradation rate of DC was studied methodically. Interestingly, about 85% of doxycycline (10 mg/L) was degraded within 120 min of light-emitting diode irradiation at pH 10. Oxygen vacancies and surface defects were determined through photoluminescence spectra. The recyclability experiments suggested that the catalyst is capable of degrading DC for three consecutive runs. Radical trapping trials suggested that holes (h+), superoxide radicals (●O2−), and hydroxyl radicals (●OH) are involved in the photodegradation of DC. Herein, the novel approach of La2CuO4 synthesis and the efficient visible-light harvesting capability of as-prepared catalyst reveal the potentiality for DC degradation thereby opening a new horizon of research employing La2CuO4 used for various environmental applications.","meta":{"doi":"802960"},"tokens":[[{"start":15,"end":37,"text":"lanthanum copper oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":60,"end":83,"text":"hydrothermal techniques","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":106,"end":129,"text":"doxycycline degradation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":135,"end":143,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":163,"end":201,"text":"photocatalytic doxycycline degradation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":246,"end":260,"text":"bandgap energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":275,"end":278,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":359,"end":376,"text":"Three-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":377,"end":389,"text":"microspheres","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":456,"end":459,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":461,"end":464,"text":"EDX","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":502,"end":509,"text":"La2CuO4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":543,"end":551,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":659,"end":670,"text":"doxycycline","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":755,"end":771,"text":"Oxygen vacancies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":776,"end":791,"text":"surface defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":816,"end":841,"text":"photoluminescence spectra","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":892,"end":900,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1029,"end":1032,"text":"O2−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1059,"end":1061,"text":"OH","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1137,"end":1144,"text":"La2CuO4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1328,"end":1335,"text":"La2CuO4","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":103,"created_at":"2022-10-21T03:01:31.923749Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T03:01:31.923749Z","lead_time":291.319}
{"text":"Quantum dots color conversion (QDCC) is considered as a facial and versatile way to achieve full-color organic light emitting diode (OLED) and micro-LED display due to the wide color gamut performance and easy integration. However, the aggregation of QDs and coffee-ring effects after solvent evaporation lowers the light conversion efficiency and emission uniformity in QDs microarrays, raising blue-light leakage or optical crosstalk. Here, we report the fabrication of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) microarrays by combining the inkjet printing and in situ fabrication of PQDs during the photopolymerization of precursor ink. The resulting PQDs microarrays exhibit three-dimensional (3D) morphology with hemisphere shape as well as strong photoluminescence, which is desirable for QDCC applications. We demonstrate the dominant role of ultraviolet (UV) curable precursors and surface functionalized substrate in controlling the shape of microarrays, where significantly increased contact angle (100°) and large height to diameter ratio (0.42) can be achieved. We further demonstrate the potential use of the in situ direct print photopolymerization method for fabricating large-area multicolor patterned pixel microarrays with a wide color gamut and high resolution.

Black phosphorus (BP), as a unique 2D member with narrow bandgap, high mobility, and strong anisotropy, has never been combined with 2D layered perovskites. Herein, we construct a new BP-based van der Waals heterostructure combing with 2D chiral hybrid perovskite (i.e., (MBA)2PbI4) for promoting the performance and enriching the functionalities of BP. A series of BP characteristics, including carrier mobility, photoresponsivity, and polarization sensitivity, are synergistically enhanced when interfacing with (MBA)2PbI4. For instance, the photodetector responsivity and photogain of BP in heterostructures are boosted by almost one order of magnitude with respect to BP alone, which is more obvious under excitation above the bandgap of perovskite. This is because the interfacing perovskite provides an inflow of numerous photogenerated carriers to BP, to reinforce the charge carrier transfer, separation, and transport processes. Additionally, the ability of both linearly and circularly polarized photodetection can be integrated into the BP/(MBA)2PbI4 heterostructure. Our work sheds new insight on the heterostructure assembly for promising optoelectronic applications within 2D materials and perovskite families.","meta":{"doi":"802957"},"tokens":[[{"start":27,"end":42,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":44,"end":46,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":48,"end":62,"text":"semiconductors","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":67,"end":85,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":151,"end":176,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":178,"end":194,"text":"Black phosphorus","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":196,"end":198,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":213,"end":215,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":235,"end":242,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":249,"end":257,"text":"mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":270,"end":280,"text":"anisotropy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":311,"end":321,"text":"2D layered","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":322,"end":333,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":362,"end":364,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":365,"end":370,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":371,"end":400,"text":"van der Waals heterostructure","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":414,"end":416,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":417,"end":423,"text":"chiral","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":424,"end":430,"text":"hybrid","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":431,"end":441,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":449,"end":459,"text":"(MBA)2PbI4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":528,"end":530,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":544,"end":546,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":574,"end":590,"text":"carrier mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":592,"end":609,"text":"photoresponsivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":615,"end":639,"text":"polarization sensitivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":692,"end":702,"text":"(MBA)2PbI4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":722,"end":748,"text":"photodetector responsivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":753,"end":762,"text":"photogain","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":766,"end":768,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":850,"end":852,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":909,"end":916,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":920,"end":930,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":964,"end":974,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1033,"end":1035,"text":"BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1226,"end":1239,"text":"BP/(MBA)2PbI4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1240,"end":1255,"text":"heterostructure","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1365,"end":1367,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1382,"end":1392,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":100,"created_at":"2022-10-21T02:44:32.757701Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T02:44:32.757701Z","lead_time":310.168}

The structure of the composites was investigated by x-ray diffraction, which confirmed the coexistence of both phases in the synthesized composites. The microstructural study by field emission electron scanning electron microscopy showed a dense and inhomogeneous distribution of grains, which increased with the increase in SBT content. Detailed dielectric studies of the composite ceramics as a function of frequency (1 kHz to 1 MHz) and temperature showed a broadening of the permittivity peak near the transition temperature. A decrease in the transition temperature with an increase in SBT content was attributed to increased inhomogeneity and internal stress. Ferroelectric study revealed that both the coercive field and remnant polarization decreased with an increase in SBT content.

{"text":"Nitrogen-doped carbons with a high specific surface area were synthesized from chitosan for use in a catalyst support of a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). First, 1 or 4 w/v% chitosan aqueous solution was hydrothermally treated at 180 °C for 20 h, producing an amorphous and insulating hydrochars. The obtained hydrochars were then pyrolyzed to nitrogen-doped carbons at 850 °C for 3 h in an inert atmosphere. As a result, nitrogen-doped carbon with a specific surface area of 1137 m2 g−1 was obtained when a 1 w/v% chitosan aqueous solution was used as the starting material. The chitosan-derived nitrogen-doped carbon with a specific surface area of 1137 m2 g−1 showed higher ORR activity than the undoped carbon with a specific surface area of 1280 m2 g−1. LaMnO3 particles as ORR catalysts were then loaded onto the chitosan-derived nitrogen-doped carbon. Notably, optimal loading amount of LaMnO3 for chitosan-derived nitrogen-doped carbon was 15 wt%, which is much lower than that for the undoped carbon. We consider that a high ability for the 4-electron ORR and high ORR activity of the chitosan-derived nitrogen-doped carbon contributed to the use of less LaMnO3 for optimal ORR activity.","meta":{"doi":"802952"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":8,"text":"Nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":9,"end":14,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":15,"end":22,"text":"carbons","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":79,"end":87,"text":"chitosan","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":101,"end":117,"text":"catalyst support","annotation":"APL"},{"start":123,"end":146,"text":"gas diffusion electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":148,"end":151,"text":"GDE","annotation":"APL"},{"start":161,"end":186,"text":"oxygen reduction reaction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":188,"end":191,"text":"ORR","annotation":"APL"},{"start":213,"end":221,"text":"chitosan","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":383,"end":391,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":392,"end":397,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":398,"end":405,"text":"carbons","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":461,"end":469,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":470,"end":475,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":476,"end":482,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":619,"end":627,"text":"chitosan","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":636,"end":644,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":645,"end":650,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":651,"end":657,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":716,"end":719,"text":"ORR","annotation":"APL"},{"start":746,"end":752,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":798,"end":804,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":818,"end":821,"text":"ORR","annotation":"APL"},{"start":822,"end":831,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":858,"end":866,"text":"chitosan","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":875,"end":883,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":884,"end":889,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":890,"end":896,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":933,"end":939,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":944,"end":952,"text":"chitosan","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":961,"end":969,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":970,"end":975,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":976,"end":982,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1041,"end":1047,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1100,"end":1103,"text":"ORR","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1113,"end":1116,"text":"ORR","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1133,"end":1141,"text":"chitosan","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1150,"end":1158,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1159,"end":1164,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1165,"end":1171,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1203,"end":1209,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1222,"end":1225,"text":"ORR","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":95,"created_at":"2022-10-21T02:24:05.399927Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T02:24:05.399927Z","lead_time":395.849}

However, thermal catalysis requires a large amount of secondary energy input, which can lead to serious environmental pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to use clean energy sunlight to catalyze solar-driven WGSR to improve the conversion efficiency at lower temperatures. Here, we reported a facile sol–gel synthesis method to prepare Cu2Y2O5 perovskite, which was photoactivated by light irradiation in 10 cm to form a heterostructure catalyst of Cu-Y2O3 supported on Cu2Y2O5 perovskite. The results showed that the catalyst well exhibited photocatalytic performance (43.7% of CO conversion and about 17 μmol·gcat−1·min−1 and 26 μmol·gcat−1·min−1 of H2 and CO2 production) and stabilized in 19 h in the solar-driven WGSR, while only 27.02% CO conversion can be achieve at about 150 °C on thermal WGSR. The physicochemical characterizations of the samples indicated that Cu0 and Cu+ existed and formed Cu0-Cu+ interface, which played a critical role in WGSR.

However, due to the large difference of the Cl and I radii, they can only substitute each other in a limited ratio to form CsPbClyI3−y (0 < y < δ or 3 − δ < y < 3).

Here, we report the synthesis of stable ∼1.73 eV MA-based mixed I/Br WBG perovskites by ionic liquid solvent, methylammonium acetate (MAAc). The special internal hydrogen bond (N—H⋯I and N—H⋯Br) environment in the ionic liquid MAAc solvent over traditional N,N-dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide solvent stabilizes the diffusion of halide ions. This allows the suppression of the halide segregation in the mixed I/Br WBG perovskite film, which is previously suggested to be difficult. The hydrogen bonds also enable excellent decoupling of the crystal nucleation and growth process.

{"text":"The highly crystallized orthoferrite of formula Nd0.5Ba0.5FeO3 (NBFO) was synthesized by the sol-gel method. The phase of our compound and the average particle size were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the NBFO sample crystallize in the cubic structure with Pm-3 m space group. The average crystallite size value determined by Williamson-Hall (W-H), Halder–Wagner (H–W) formula and using the method of Debye-Scherer is in the range of 60 nm, 56 nm and 55 nm, respectively. In the other hand, SEM result shows an overall average particle size of about 251 nm. Obviously, the particle sizes observed by SEM are larger than those calculated by XRD, which indicates that each particle observed by SEM consists of several crystallized grains. Moreover, the antiferromagnetic (AFM)–paramagnetic (PM) phase transition has been confirmed by magnetic measurements at 0.05 T applied field. This AFM–PM transition has been observed for the Neel temperature TN = 49 K. Frequency and temperature dependencies of capacitance (C−f/T) and conductance (G−f/T) of the sample were investigated in the frequency and temperature ranges of 40 Hz–100 MHz and 220–400 K, respectively. On the other hand, the optical characteristics of this polycrystalline were analyzed by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. By investigating the UV absorption and reflectance measurements, we identify the direct optical band gap close to 4.75 eV, which confirms that our sample is a direct gap semiconductor. In addition, the Urbach energy, the optical extinction coefficient and the refractive index were determined from the absorbance and reflectance measurements. We have also shown that the refractive index n follows the Cauchy law in the area where the absorbance is maximized. On the other hand, the dispersion parameters E0 and Ed of this compound have been calculated based to the Wemple-Didomenico model.

{"text":"Due to their excellent advantages such as low toxicity, superior optoelectronic properties, low-temperature fabrication, and cost-effectiveness, Sn-based perovskites have become the most promising alternatives for high performance lead-free perovskite solar cells. However, the character of Sn2+ is easily oxidized to Sn4+, causing unnecessary p-type self-doping and high leakage current. More seriously, trap-induced non-radiative recombination from rapid crystallization causes into large energy loss with a low open circuit voltage. Therefore, the Sn-based solar cells have efficiency far behind the Pb-based solar cells. Herein, the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) is used to control crystal growth and passivate the defects in FA0.85PEA0.15SnI3 thin film. This Sn-perovskite layer shows compact crystal with large grain size and reduced defects.

{"text":"In this study, a single-phase quadruple perovskite oxide powder, Cu3.21Ti1.16Nb2.63O12, was synthesized, and the novel coexistence of Cu2+ and Cu+ was confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We produced a dense, sintered body with a relative density of 96% by firing at 885 °C in air. The sintered body exhibited an electrical conductivity of 2.2 S/cm, a Seebeck coefficient of − 280 μV/K, a thermal conductivity of 2.4 W/m K at 730 °C, and a relatively low dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of approximately 0.006. The main reason for the low ZT was the low electrical conductivity, which was approximately 1/100 of that of Na0.7CoO2, which is a typical thermoelectrical oxide. However, the obtained ZT value was higher than that of similar CaCu3Ti4O12-based oxides, indicating the significant potential of the as-prepared perovskite oxide as a thermoelectric material. The electrical conductivity exhibited an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence above room temperature, and its activation energy was 0.1 eV, which was equivalent to that of CuO hopping conduction. This suggested that hopping conduction between Cu+ and Cu2+ plays a significant role in the electrical conduction of this system.

{"text":"Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) based on cesium lead halide CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have rapidly emerged as one of the most promising photonic materials in recent years due to their characteristic high quantum efficiency and narrow emission bandwidth. However, their poor stability against external influences such as moisture, oxygen, heat, and light irradiation has hindered their practical photonic applications in light-emitting diodes, displays, and photovoltaic cells. Among various attempts to overcome their shortcomings, an inorganic glass matrix can be an effective and practical solution, providing chemically stable encapsulation of the PNCs. Significant improvements in chemical, thermal, and photo-stabilities compared with the colloidal PNCs have been reported, without degrading their unique optical properties.

We obtained the optimal structure parameter of the hybrid plasmonic waveguide, which could achieve a low gain threshold of 0.72 μm−1 in the visible region.

{"text":"The non-radiative recombination loss caused by diverse defects within SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL), perovskite film, and their interface greatly hinders the further improvement of the performance and stability of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Therefore, it is urgent to develop an effective strategy to address these issues. Herein, a multifunctional material, phospho-ethanolamine (PE), is introduced into SnO2 aqueous colloids to suppress defects and prepare high-quality ETL. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of PE can significantly reduce the number of Sn dangling bonds due to the formation of new Sn—O—P bonds, which is beneficial to ameliorating the electrical properties of SnO2 and obtaining dense SnO2 film. Meanwhile, the amino group (NH2) of PE can interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, thereby suppressing SnO2/perovskite interface defects and obtaining improved perovskite film quality. Consequently, the optimized flexible and rigid PSCs based on the SnO2-PE composite ETL yield outstanding photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.48% and 21.61%, respectively. Moreover, flexible PSCs based on SnO2-PE present excellent mechanical durability, and 90.6% of the original PCE is retained after 1000 bending cycles.","meta":{"doi":"802920"},"tokens":[[{"start":70,"end":74,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":75,"end":99,"text":"electron transport layer","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":101,"end":104,"text":"ETL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":107,"end":117,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":118,"end":122,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":207,"end":216,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":229,"end":251,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":253,"end":257,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":378,"end":398,"text":"phospho-ethanolamine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":400,"end":402,"text":"PE","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":424,"end":428,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":491,"end":494,"text":"ETL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":429,"end":445,"text":"aqueous colloids","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":546,"end":548,"text":"PE","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":588,"end":590,"text":"Sn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":634,"end":640,"text":"Sn—O—P","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":641,"end":646,"text":"bonds","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":713,"end":717,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":738,"end":742,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":743,"end":747,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":777,"end":780,"text":"NH2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":764,"end":769,"text":"amino","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":785,"end":787,"text":"PE","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":820,"end":824,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":828,"end":838,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":860,"end":864,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":865,"end":875,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":917,"end":927,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":928,"end":932,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":989,"end":993,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1007,"end":1014,"text":"SnO2-PE","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1025,"end":1028,"text":"ETL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1047,"end":1082,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1084,"end":1087,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1144,"end":1148,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1158,"end":1165,"text":"SnO2-PE","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1233,"end":1236,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1184,"end":1205,"text":"mechanical durability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":63,"created_at":"2022-10-20T11:32:25.080017Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T11:32:25.080017Z","lead_time":355.721}

We found that the introduction of RhB can significantly improve the light absorption and photo-responsivity of the composite devices. The devices exhibit acceptable synaptic behaviors and realize a brain-like learning pattern toward various input signals. Notably, the devices can respond to light signals with a low intensity of 1.1 µW cm−2 and be operated at low working voltages. The devices achieve a low energy consumption of 1.25 fJ at a drain-source voltage of −50 µV, comparable to that of a biological synaptic event. Moreover, the devices simulate a self-learning process, indicating their significantly improved learning efficiency.

This study demonstrates ultrathin FPSCs on 3-μm-thick parylene-C substrates via a flip-over transferring process. The Zr, Ti and Ga-doped indium oxide (ITGZO) film is employed as the bottom transparent electrode of ultrathin inverted FPSCs with a remarkable PCE of 20.2%, which is comparable to that based on common FPSCs. Devices on glasses and parylene-F (i.e., parylene-VT4) substrates were also constructed to verify the advantages of parylene-C.

However, the photoresponse performance of the pure perovskite QDs-based PDs is usually limited by the poor charge transport efficiency of the perovskite QDs films. Here, high-performance self-powered PDs based on perovskite QDs and organic semiconductor PQT-12 (poly(3,3‴-didodecyl quarterthiophene)) are reported. Even in a self-powered mode, the devices can still show stable photoresponse to light signals and achieve excellent photodetection performance, including a detectivity up to 5.8 × 1012 Jones, and Ilight/Idark ratio up to 105. More importantly, the devices exhibit obvious photoresponse to weak light with intensity as low as 3 nW cm−2. To the best of our knowledge, the weak light detection ability of the device is better than most reported PDs based on perovskite QDs. In addition, the devices can be fabricated into flexible PDs with almost unchanged photocurrent under different bending angles. The overall performances of our devices are excellent among the reported self-powered PDs.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that all the obtained perovskites crystallize in an orthorhombic structure (pbnm space group) with traces as secondary phases. The crystallite sizes are 62.15, 51.4, 45, 51, and 56.78 nm for Sn0.05, Sn0.10, Sn0.15, Sn0.20, and Sn0.25 samples, respectively. Morphological investigations confirm the presence of fine nanosized particles of no similar shape and a high tendency to agglomerate. Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirm the presence of consistent and estimated grain sizes with tin content in the grain size range 278, 192, and 238 nm for Sn0.05, Sn0.15, and Sn0.25 samples, respectively. The crystallite size and particle size show a low value for the Sn0.15 sample, indicating the well-incorporated Sn ions in the lattice. The DC electrical conductivity σDC data showed the presence of a semiconductor behavior in overall temperature range 303–428 K. The activation energy Ea is estimated for all the samples using the small polaron hopping (SPH) model conduction mechanism to be 0.3, 0.31, 0.36, 0.34, and 0.33 eV for Sn0.05, Sn0.10, Sn0.15, Sn0.20, and Sn0.25 samples, respectively. Ea shows a significant variation around 192-nm particle size. This can be explained in terms of long-range charge ordering (CO) melting around this particle size or the grain boundary associated with that sample's small crystallite and grain size. The best conductivity of 160.84 m−1 Ω−1 is for the Sn0.15 sample due to low crystallite and particle size, which improves grain boundaries and increases Ea. The magnetic field ± 20 kG dependence of magnetization is studied at room temperature. Sr0.85Pb0.15Mn1-xSnxO3 nanoparticles behave as paramagnetic, and the suppression of the scattering of the magnetic domain with an applied magnetic field is designated. Hc, Ms, and Mr are estimated and the best Hc = 50.99 G, Ms = 0.49 emu/g, and Mr = 25 × 10−4 was found for the Sn0.15 sample.

One of the main concerns regarding the PSC during its service life is nonlinear instability due to ultra-thin structural features and dynamic loadings. This paper presents a framework for nonlinear dynamic and stability analyses of the PSC with oblique stiffeners that are integrated as enhancements against external impacts. Considering von-Kármán geometric nonlinearity and smeared oblique stiffeners, the dynamic governing equation is derived by capitalizing on Airy’s stress function and the Galerkin approach. The deduced nonlinear motion equation can be effectively solved by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, such that the natural frequency, wind-induced nonlinear vibration behaviour, and dynamic buckling characteristics of the stiffened PSC can be assessed. The accuracy of the developed framework is verified with established benchmarks. Moreover, the effects of the damping ratio, thermal variance, wind load, compression speed, elastic foundation, initial imperfection, compression ratio, oblique stiffeners, and active layer thickness on the structural response and stability are thoroughly examined. Concluding remarks, drawn from this study, on the mechanical performance and stability of the novel PSC will benefit the practical design and application of PSC energy harvesting devices.","meta":{"doi":"802909"},"tokens":[[{"start":4,"end":25,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":27,"end":30,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":187,"end":190,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":218,"end":239,"text":"nonlinear instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":384,"end":387,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":358,"end":367,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":336,"end":353,"text":"nonlinear dynamic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":393,"end":411,"text":"oblique stiffeners","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":532,"end":550,"text":"oblique stiffeners","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":613,"end":635,"text":"Airy’s stress function","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":644,"end":661,"text":"Galerkin approach","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":734,"end":765,"text":"fourth-order Runge–Kutta method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":781,"end":798,"text":"natural frequency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":800,"end":842,"text":"wind-induced nonlinear vibration behaviour","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":848,"end":880,"text":"dynamic buckling characteristics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":898,"end":901,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1029,"end":1042,"text":"damping ratio","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1044,"end":1060,"text":"thermal variance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1062,"end":1071,"text":"wind load","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1073,"end":1090,"text":"compression speed","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1092,"end":1110,"text":"elastic foundation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1112,"end":1132,"text":"initial imperfection","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1134,"end":1151,"text":"compression ratio","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1153,"end":1171,"text":"oblique stiffeners","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1177,"end":1199,"text":"active layer thickness","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1231,"end":1240,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1366,"end":1369,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1423,"end":1426,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":52,"created_at":"2022-10-20T08:13:02.382804Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T08:13:02.383805Z","lead_time":362.613}
{"text":"Fullerene derivatives have a wide range of applications in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), such as electron transport layers (ETLs), interfacial modifiers, and additives. However, there have been few studies of the use of endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs) to improve the performance of PSCs. Here, a novel EMF (Y3N@C80) was synthesized and used as an interfacial modifier in PSC devices based on a SnO2 ETL. Energy level mismatches and detrimental carrier recombination have been observed in devices with a pristine SnO2 ETL, but these issues are alleviated with the assistance of Y3N@C80. A significant increase in open-circuit voltage from 1.106 V (SnO2) to 1.14 V (SnO2-Y3N@C80), an increase in power conversion efficiency from 20.59% to 21.66%, and a marked reduction in hysteresis were observed, which were attributed to the more suitable conduction band energy levels and more effective electron extraction at the SnO2-Y3N@C80/perovskite interface. In addition, the stability of the target devices was improved, which may be due to the hydrophobicity of Y3N@C80 and a reduction in trap states.","meta":{"doi":"802908"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":9,"text":"Fullerene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":10,"end":21,"text":"derivatives","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":59,"end":81,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":83,"end":87,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":98,"end":123,"text":"electron transport layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":125,"end":129,"text":"ETLs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":132,"end":153,"text":"interfacial modifiers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":159,"end":168,"text":"additives","annotation":"APL"},{"start":221,"end":249,"text":"endohedral metallofullerenes","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":251,"end":255,"text":"EMFs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":287,"end":291,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":307,"end":310,"text":"EMF","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":312,"end":319,"text":"Y3N@C80","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":376,"end":379,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":399,"end":403,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":404,"end":407,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":409,"end":421,"text":"Energy level","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":517,"end":521,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":582,"end":589,"text":"Y3N@C80","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":617,"end":637,"text":"open-circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":652,"end":656,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":699,"end":726,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":845,"end":860,"text":"conduction band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":861,"end":874,"text":"energy levels","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":669,"end":681,"text":"SnO2-Y3N@C80","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":921,"end":933,"text":"SnO2-Y3N@C80","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":934,"end":944,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":945,"end":954,"text":"interface","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":973,"end":982,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1043,"end":1057,"text":"hydrophobicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1061,"end":1068,"text":"Y3N@C80","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":51,"created_at":"2022-10-20T08:06:58.541713Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T08:06:58.541713Z","lead_time":829.853}

{"text":"In the era of modern photovoltaic technology, perovskite solar cell is one of the most intriguing topics for its cost-effective fabrication step and high absorbance. Tin-based and lead-based perovskites are the two popular compounds of perovskite cell fabrication. Generally, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the stability of tin-based perovskite are much less than the lead-based perovskite. However, the toxicity of lead demotivates usage of this material as the absorber layer. To remove this problem, an alternative solution of tin-based perovskite with a configuration of glass substrate/FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3SnI3/HTM/back contact is briefly investigated in this paper. The thickness optimization effects of perovskite and hole transport material (HTM) on overall PCE is also observed. Moreover, the impact of the hole transport layer (HTL) with its characteristic parameters such as bandgap and hole mobilities on the PCE with five different HTMs, i.e., Spiro-OMeTAD, CuI, Cu2O, NiO, and PEDOT:PSS, are studied through the proposed numerical model. Finally, it is found that the inorganic HTMs, i.e., CuI and Cu2O, show better PCE than the organic materials Spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PSS. The highest PCE as an HTM is reordered for CuI with the PCE of 21.0%.","meta":{"doi":"802906"},"tokens":[[{"start":46,"end":67,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":154,"end":164,"text":"absorbance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":166,"end":169,"text":"Tin","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":170,"end":175,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":180,"end":184,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":185,"end":190,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":191,"end":202,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":236,"end":251,"text":"perovskite cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":280,"end":307,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":309,"end":312,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":322,"end":331,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":335,"end":338,"text":"tin","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":339,"end":344,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":345,"end":355,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":379,"end":383,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":390,"end":400,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":384,"end":389,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":415,"end":423,"text":"toxicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":427,"end":431,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":541,"end":544,"text":"tin","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":545,"end":550,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":551,"end":561,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":586,"end":601,"text":"glass substrate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":602,"end":605,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":606,"end":610,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":611,"end":621,"text":"CH3NH3SnI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":622,"end":625,"text":"HTM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":716,"end":726,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":756,"end":759,"text":"HTM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":772,"end":775,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":731,"end":745,"text":"hole transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":822,"end":836,"text":"hole transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":837,"end":842,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":844,"end":847,"text":"HTL","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":892,"end":899,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":927,"end":930,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":951,"end":955,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":963,"end":975,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":977,"end":980,"text":"CuI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":982,"end":986,"text":"Cu2O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":988,"end":991,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":997,"end":1006,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1098,"end":1102,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1110,"end":1113,"text":"CuI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1118,"end":1122,"text":"Cu2O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1136,"end":1139,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1167,"end":1179,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1184,"end":1193,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1207,"end":1210,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1217,"end":1220,"text":"HTM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1238,"end":1241,"text":"CuI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1251,"end":1254,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":49,"created_at":"2022-10-20T07:43:44.960717Z","updated_at":"2022-10-20T07:43:44.960717Z","lead_time":414.756}

{"text":"Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) find a central role in the flourishing semiconductor industry with desirable optical and electronic properties with wider applicability. In this report, we have demonstrated a Schottky device using formamidinium lead halide (FAPbI3-XBrX) perovskite nanocrystals to reveal their Schottky parameters, such as rectification ratio (RR), barrier height (φb), ideality factor (η), and reverse saturation current (I0). The nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized from a solution-induced recrystallization method in ambient conditions with a crystallite size of ~ 22 nm and a photoluminescence peak at 609 nm. The Schottky parameters were determined from thin-film devices by measuring current–voltage characteristics in dark conditions and thereafter analyzed from thermionic emission theory.

The Schottky parameters of the devices were found to only slightly degrade after being kept at ambient conditions for about 60 days.

{"text":"Ultraviolet (UV) detectors are used in diverse areas of light detection and image analysis, such as astronomy, medicine, and environmental monitoring. Most of the UVC emitted from the sun is absorbed by ozone and does not reach the earth's surface; as a result, only a weak signal is detected. However, UVC is also produced by artificial sources and can have detrimental effects on health and materials. To measure UVC accurately it is desirable to develop a semiconductor UVC photodetector that converts an incident optical signal into an electrical signal for analysis. Recently, ultraviolet detectors based on the semiconductor characteristics of perovskite have attracted attention. Perovskite effectively absorbs a wide range of wavelengths and has high charge-carrier mobility. In this study, the (FAPbI3)x(MAPbI3)1-x mixed cation perovskite was used as the light-absorbing layer of a photodetector.

Especially, the dielectric confinement and ionic sublattice lead to strong coupling between the photogenerated excitons and the phonons from the polar lattice which intensively affects the properties for device applications. The anharmonicity and dynamic disorder from the organic cations participate in the relaxation dynamics coupled with excitations.

{"text":"Organic—inorganic hybrid two dimensional (2D) lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are tunable quantum wells that exhibit a set of intriguing structural and physical properties including soft and dynamic lattices, organic—inorganic epitaxial heterointerfaces, quantum and dielectric confinements, strong light—matter interactions, and large spin—orbit coupling, which enable promising perspectives for optoelectronics, ferroelectrics, and spintronics. While the properties of 2D LHPs bear some resemblance of the 3D LHPs, they are often drastically altered due to the reduced dimensionality and the complex interactions between organic and inorganic components. In this review, we discuss the influences of the reduced dimensionality and the organic—inorganic interplays on the structural stability and distortion of the inorganic lattices, inversion symmetry of the crystal structure, electronic band structures, excitonic physics, and carrier—phonon interactions in 2D LHPs. An emphasis is placed on the relationships between the crystal structures and photophysical properties.

{"text":"The cobalt catalysts supported on perovskite-type XCeO3 (X: Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) oxide were prepared for the decomposition of ammonia. The influence of different alkaline earth metals in support composition on the catalytic activity of Co/XCeO3 catalysts has been studied. A nominal 5 wt% Co loading was maintained over these perovskite supports. The catalytic ammonia decomposition performance was studied in the temperature range 300–600 °C. The catalyst 5Co–BaCeO (5 wt% Co impregnated on BaCeO3 support) showed the highest activity among the all other catalysts and the sequential order of exhibited NH3 conversion was as follows: 5Co–MgCeO < 5Co–CaCeO ≤ 5Co–SrCeO < 5Co–BaCeO. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, TPR, CO2-TPD and SEM techniques. The results showed that the interaction between BaCeO3 and Co is beneficial to electron conductivity that promotes the catalytic activity of 5Co–BaCeO.

{"text":"Recent studies show that the increased demand for energy in industries influences the research interest in environmental and energy issues. This demand leads to more intense research on renewable energy sources via solar cells, wind energy and piezo electric materials. This review article provides insights on the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), explicitly DSSCs, emphasizing perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In the last decade, due to their remarkable properties, researchers have investigated metal halide perovskite solar cells (MHPSCs) in photovoltaic technologies. These include defect tolerance, high absorption coefficients, low cost, and long lifetime with feasible processing methods. The MHPSCs have achieved a power conversion efficiency of around 25% with a bandgap of ~ 1.6 eV. In this perspective, we emphasize the study of diverse nanomaterials of low cost, which can be integrated into the perovskite structure to form solar cells. Initially, a basic overview of the perovskite solar cell evolution from DSSC is highlighted with an emphasis on the need for solid-state devices. Further, numerous nanomaterial applications in DSSCs and PSCs are reviewed and demonstrated.

{"text":"Inorganic-organic metal halide perovskite light harvester-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with widely tunable bandgap have achieved rapid growth in power conversion efficiency, which exceeds 25% now. It is deliberated that if a semitransparent solar cell made of wider bandgap materials was placed on top of a narrow bandgap materials-based solar cell such as a silicon solar cell, with proper optical and electrical arrangements, the resultant tandem device consisting of two subcells could more effectively utilize the solar spectrum than a single junction solar cell. In a perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell (PSTSC), a semitransparent PSC with a wider bandgap is placed on top of a narrow bandgap silicon solar cell. The PSC efficiently harvests the higher energy photons in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the solar spectrum while the silicon solar cell can convert the photons of the infrared region to power. The PSTSC is proposed as a potential candidate to overcome the Shockley-Queisser limit of single-junction silicon solar cells. Though the theoretical limit of a PSTSC is calculated as ∼42%, its actual efficiency achieved until now is less than 30%. Therefore, a great scope of research exists in improving the efficiency of PSTSCs. Current issues of stability and upscaling of the device in PSCs are also a matter of concern for PSTSCs. A tandem device consists of multiple parts, and different configurations can be applied, thus tuning the architecture of the device. Altering various parts may result in significant changes in the efficiency of the device. In this review, competing architectures of otherwise comparable devices are compared in terms of photovoltaic properties. Thus, future directions to improve the efficiency of the device based on architecture design are proposed herein. In particular, the influence of the polarity of PSCs and the surface morphology of silicon solar cells (both front and rear) on determining the properties of the PSTSC are discussed.","meta":{"doi":"802889"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":17,"text":"Inorganic-organic","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":18,"end":23,"text":"metal","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":24,"end":30,"text":"halide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":31,"end":41,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":64,"end":86,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":88,"end":92,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":114,"end":121,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":152,"end":179,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":232,"end":258,"text":"semitransparent solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":273,"end":280,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":321,"end":328,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":345,"end":355,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":366,"end":384,"text":"silicon solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":563,"end":573,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":580,"end":616,"text":"perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":618,"end":623,"text":"PSTSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":644,"end":647,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":661,"end":668,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":698,"end":705,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":706,"end":724,"text":"silicon solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":730,"end":733,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":852,"end":870,"text":"silicon solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":932,"end":937,"text":"PSTSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":991,"end":1014,"text":"Shockley-Queisser limit","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1018,"end":1053,"text":"single-junction silicon solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1089,"end":1094,"text":"PSTSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1252,"end":1258,"text":"PSTSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1278,"end":1287,"text":"stability","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1319,"end":1323,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1357,"end":1363,"text":"PSTSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1872,"end":1876,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1885,"end":1903,"text":"surface morphology","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1907,"end":1926,"text":"silicon solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1986,"end":1991,"text":"PSTSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1860,"end":1868,"text":"polarity","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":32,"created_at":"2022-10-19T12:00:59.512798Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T12:00:59.512798Z","lead_time":428.795}

{"text":"The open-circuit voltage (Voc) in a thin-film n-i-p-type perovskite solar cell (PSC) depends on the quasi-Fermi-level splitting (QFLS) in the perovskite layer. Recent photo/electroluminescence measurements show that the Voc in practical devices is lower than the QFLS in the bare perovskite film, suggesting that the device performance is limited by the interfaces. The losses at the perovskite/transport layer (TL) interface can be caused by (a) the suboptimal band alignment between perovskite and TL, or (b) the interface defects. Previously, we reported a polymer interlayer, poly-4-(5-(9,9-dihexyl-7-methyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PF-DTDFBT) having efficient band matching with valence band maxima (VBM) of perovskite (MAPbI3), which enhanced the Voc of the n-i-p structured PSC.

Firstly, the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and carrier lifetime measurements show that the polymer does not passivate the surface of the perovskite, and hence interface defects do not limit the Voc. On the other hand, comparison of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the polymer with that of Spiro-OMeTAD, shows that the alignment with the VBM of MAPbI3 is better for polymer than for Spiro-OMeTAD. From these two observations, it is inferred that the enhancement in Voc is due to the efficient HOMO/VBM alignment of the polymer interlayer and the perovskite (MAPbI3). As perovskite film quality and defect density are heavily dependent on the fabrication process, the device fabrication and stability measurements were repeated with the widely accepted planar antisolvent-treated perovskite films (as compared with the methylamine vapor-treated films used previously). The planar, antisolvent recipe-based devices showed enhanced performance for both Spiro-OMeTAD (reference) and polymer-interlayer-based devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the polymer interlayer device was 16.51% with Voc of 1.11 V compared with PCE of 14.72% and Voc of 1.04 V for the reference Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. The polymer being hydrophobic, enhanced the stability of the interlayer devices, whose PCE drops by only 22% after 240 h of exposure to 72 ± 3% relative humidity as compared with a 60% drop in efficiency of the reference Spiro-OMeTAD devices kept in the same ambient conditions and time frame.","meta":{"doi":"802885"},"tokens":[[{"start":4,"end":24,"text":"open-circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":26,"end":29,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":36,"end":45,"text":"thin-film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":46,"end":56,"text":"n-i-p-type","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":57,"end":78,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":80,"end":83,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":100,"end":127,"text":"quasi-Fermi-level splitting","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":129,"end":133,"text":"QFLS","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":142,"end":152,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":153,"end":158,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":220,"end":223,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":263,"end":267,"text":"QFLS","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":280,"end":290,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":291,"end":295,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":384,"end":394,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":395,"end":410,"text":"transport layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":412,"end":414,"text":"TL","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":451,"end":466,"text":"suboptimal band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":485,"end":495,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":500,"end":502,"text":"TL","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":580,"end":719,"text":"poly-4-(5-(9,9-dihexyl-7-methyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(5-methylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (PF-DTDFBT)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":737,"end":741,"text":"band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":756,"end":775,"text":"valence band maxima","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":785,"end":795,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":797,"end":803,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":825,"end":828,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":836,"end":841,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":853,"end":856,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":915,"end":918,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":933,"end":965,"text":"x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":970,"end":999,"text":"carrier lifetime measurements","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1060,"end":1070,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1117,"end":1120,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1082,"end":1099,"text":"interface defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1159,"end":1193,"text":"highest occupied molecular orbital","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1195,"end":1199,"text":"HOMO","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1229,"end":1241,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1277,"end":1280,"text":"VBM","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1284,"end":1290,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1322,"end":1334,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1404,"end":1407,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1432,"end":1436,"text":"HOMO","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1437,"end":1440,"text":"VBM","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1485,"end":1495,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1497,"end":1503,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1509,"end":1519,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1520,"end":1524,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1718,"end":1728,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1729,"end":1734,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1783,"end":1788,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1757,"end":1768,"text":"methylamine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1889,"end":1901,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1956,"end":1983,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1985,"end":1988,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2067,"end":2070,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2117,"end":2129,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2085,"end":2088,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2130,"end":2135,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":2232,"end":2235,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2366,"end":2378,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2163,"end":2174,"text":"hydrophobic","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":28,"created_at":"2022-10-19T09:01:14.913981Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T09:17:26.754729Z","lead_time":1040.842}
{"text":"Inverse perovskites are the counterparts to the largest family of crystalline perovskite materials and have attracted significant research interest because of their unconventional physical and chemical properties. Perovskite materials have been studied widely; however, less attention has been paid to their counterparts (inverse perovskites). In the present study, we report on the structural, electronic, elastic, mechanical, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of unexplored Rh-based XCRh3 (X = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Pd, Ag) inverse perovskites. The first-principles density functional theory-based linearized augmented plane wave method as implemented in the Wien2k package with the generalized gradient approximation was employed for the investigation of the physical properties. The computed formation energies showed that the majority of these materials comparatively favor the ferromagnetic phase over the non-magnetic phase. Amongst the studied XCRh3, X = Ti-, V-, Cr-, Mn-, Zn- and Zr-based materials comprise negative formation energies confirming the energetic stability. All the compounds other than NbCRh3 and MoCRh3 were found mechanically stable. Spin-projected electronic properties of XCRh3 revealed the conducting features in both spin versions. The large magnetic moments per unit cell (> 3μB) of CrCRh3, MnCRh3, FeCRh3 and TcCRh3 were observed with dominant contribution from X-atoms. Mechanical anisotropy and other bulk mechanical parameters are elaborated and discussed in detail. The thermodynamic properties including specific heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and Debye temperature are scrutinized at different temperature and pressure ranges.","meta":{"doi":"802884"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":19,"text":"Inverse perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":66,"end":88,"text":"crystalline perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":214,"end":224,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":322,"end":341,"text":"inverse perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":480,"end":482,"text":"Rh","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":483,"end":488,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":489,"end":558,"text":"XCRh3 (X = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Pd, Ag)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":559,"end":578,"text":"inverse perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":580,"end":626,"text":"The first-principles density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":627,"end":632,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":633,"end":671,"text":"linearized augmented plane wave method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":694,"end":700,"text":"Wien2k","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":718,"end":752,"text":"generalized gradient approximation","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":829,"end":847,"text":"formation energies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":916,"end":929,"text":"ferromagnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":945,"end":957,"text":"non-magnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1026,"end":1031,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1060,"end":1078,"text":"formation energies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1104,"end":1113,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1144,"end":1150,"text":"NbCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1155,"end":1161,"text":"MoCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":985,"end":990,"text":"XCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":996,"end":998,"text":"Ti","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1001,"end":1002,"text":"V","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1005,"end":1007,"text":"Cr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1010,"end":1012,"text":"Mn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1015,"end":1017,"text":"Zn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1023,"end":1025,"text":"Zr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1234,"end":1239,"text":"XCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1348,"end":1354,"text":"CrCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1356,"end":1362,"text":"MnCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1364,"end":1370,"text":"FeCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1375,"end":1381,"text":"TcCRh3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1437,"end":1458,"text":"Mechanical anisotropy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1575,"end":1597,"text":"specific heat capacity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1599,"end":1628,"text":"thermal expansion coefficient","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1633,"end":1650,"text":"Debye temperature","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":27,"created_at":"2022-10-19T08:59:40.211062Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T08:59:40.211062Z","lead_time":543.611}

{"text":"Formamidine (FA)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for photoelectric conversion devices due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the instability of perovskites, especially moisture instability, remains one of the biggest obstacles to the commercialization of perovskite devices. Therefore, it is very important to explore and target the effect of moisture on FA-based perovskites to prevent this effect and improve device stability. Herein, we studied the degradation process of commonly used FA-based perovskite films by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy characterization and analyzed the reasons for their humidity-induced degradation. Subsequently, we further adopted a strategy by adding methylammonium bromine powder into a PbI2 precursor solution to prepare a seed solution in a two-step preparation process to enhance the performance and stability of FA-based PSCs. Finally, the degradation rate of the obtained perovskite film was significantly slowed down under high humidity compared to that of perovskite films prepared by a two-step method without applying a seed solution. The corresponding device achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 23.22%, and the efficiency of this device showed no attenuation after 900 h of exposure to air.","meta":{"doi":"802882"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":11,"text":"Formamidine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":13,"end":15,"text":"FA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":17,"end":22,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":23,"end":45,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":47,"end":51,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":82,"end":114,"text":"photoelectric conversion devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":178,"end":189,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":193,"end":204,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":217,"end":237,"text":"moisture instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":304,"end":314,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":404,"end":406,"text":"FA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":407,"end":412,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":413,"end":424,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":467,"end":476,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":538,"end":540,"text":"FA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":541,"end":546,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":558,"end":563,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":547,"end":557,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":567,"end":584,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":589,"end":634,"text":"scanning electron microscopy characterization","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":670,"end":698,"text":"humidity-induced degradation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":754,"end":776,"text":"methylammonium bromine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":777,"end":783,"text":"powder","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":791,"end":795,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":920,"end":922,"text":"FA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":923,"end":928,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":929,"end":933,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":981,"end":991,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":992,"end":996,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1038,"end":1046,"text":"humidity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1067,"end":1077,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1078,"end":1083,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1195,"end":1222,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":25,"created_at":"2022-10-19T08:45:10.776812Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T08:45:10.776812Z","lead_time":397.364}
{"text":"Tin (Sn)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently made inspiring progress, and certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached impressive value of 14.8%. However, it is still challenging to realize efficient and stable 3D Sn-based PSCs due to the fast crystallization and easy Sn2+ oxidation of Sn-based perovskite. Herein, we reported the utilization of a reductive ionic liquid, methylamine formate (MAFa), to drive the controlled crystallization process and suppress Sn2+ oxidation of FASnI3 perovskite film. The coordination of C=O and Sn2+ and the hydrogen bonding of N-H⋯I between the MAFa and FASnI3 precursors are shown to be responsible for retarding the crystallization of FASnI3 during film-forming process, which promotes the oriented growth and reduced defect traps of the film. Moreover, the strong reducibility of −CHO groups in Fa− suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+ in the film. As a result, MAFa-modified 3D PSCs device could reach champion PCE of up to 8.50%, which is enhanced by 26.11% compared to the control device with PCE of 6.74%. Most importantly, the MAFa-modified device shows much improved stability compared to the control device under same conditions without encapsulation.

{"text":"Lithium-ion hybrid capacitors (LIHCs) are gaining more attention and applications because they break the performance limitations of supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the difference of energy storage mechanism between anode and cathode is a problem that must be faced by Li-ion hybrid capacitors. The selection of suitable anode and cathode materials is one of the effective ways to solve this problem. Here, we synthesized hollow spherical perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 by a simple and safe method. The specific capacity of NaNiF3 is 142 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 for 1000 cycles. The mechanism in the cycling of NaNiF3 electrodes was investigated using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which is typical of the conversion reaction.

Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) nanofibers modified with black-phase cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) nanocrystals (NCs) have been prepared by a one-stage electrospinning method followed by an annealing process. The average diameter of drop-free nanofibers has been varied in the range of 81–579 nm by manipulating the concentration of the entire material from 47.39% to 41.39%; the concentration of perovskite from 33.33% to 46.67%; the concentration of PVP from 7.5% to 15%; the needle diameter from 0.42 mm to 0.72 mm; the feed rate from 0.1 ml/h to 0.3 ml/h; the electrical voltage from 17 to 23 kV; and the working distance from 120 to 150 mm.

Light absorption and photoluminescence (PL) properties improve with an increase in the annealing temperature from 150 °C to 200 °C due to the growth in grain size. The optical bandgap has been found to be ~ 1.77 eV and 1.74 eV at 150 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The formation mechanism of stable NCs has been presented. The low annealing temperature can be explained by the formation of ionic clusters and the aggregation of perovskite precursors around the polymer chains in the intermediate phase, promoting the non-classical nucleation. The stability at room conditions is attributed to the small size of crystals and their complexation with PVP, which allows the fabrication of stable nanofibers for 15 days.","meta":{"doi":"802879"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":18,"text":"Polymer–perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":19,"end":29,"text":"nanofibers","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":22,"created_at":"2022-10-19T08:04:28.415073Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T08:04:28.415073Z","lead_time":298.401}

Therefore, developing an economical strategy to achieve the batch synthesis of RENiO3 is of vital importance.

By optimizing the reaction conditions, the powder of RENiO3 with the cubic shape and average size of ~ 2 μm was effectively synthesized, while their phase purity exceeded 95%.

Nonetheless, their production still suffers from the limited productivity at the bench level. In this work, we fabricated CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) NCs within droplet-based micro-reactors, where both the nucleation and growth processes could be precisely controlled inside 130-nL microdroplets. This provides a new paradigm for the large-scale synthesis of perovskite NCs with high PLQY. Compared with other synthetic methods, this method can increase the concentration of reactant precursors by 3–116 times, while lowering the ligand to reactant ratio to 2%–50% of the commonly used hot-injection method. By modulating the reaction temperature and residence time, the structure-function relationship between the morphology of NCs and PL properties was extensively investigated. The microfluidic-based process allows the flexible adjustment in the proportion of PbX2 precursors to achieve the fabrication of perovskite NCs whose luminescence range covers the entire visible spectrum (406–677 nm) within one reaction.

{"text":"The strong aggregation tendency of hole transport material poly[3-(4-carboxylbutyl) thiophene-K (P3CT-K) restricts its further application in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we report an effective strategy to address this issue and achieve the superior performance of inverted methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) PSCs, in which graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) doped P3CT-K nanocomposites are applied as the hole transport nanolayer (HTL). It is revealed that the strong π−π stacking interaction occurs between GDYO and P3CT-K, which is proved by the blue shift of the absorption peak of P3CT-K nanolayer. The aggregation control via GDYO contributes to the property improvement of P3CT-K HTL. Moreover, the homogeneous coverage induces the growth of perovskite grain with larger size than that based on the undoped one. As a result, the optimized surface morphology, enhanced conductivity, charge extraction as well as better crystal quality, finally improve the device performance. An optimal power conversion efficiency of 19.06% is achieved, with simultaneously improved fill factor and short circuit current density.

{"text":"The effect of isomorphic substitution of atoms on crystal structure and properties of oxide compounds is one of the main tasks of modern materials science. This work is devoted to the study of Ba atoms by smaller Sr atoms’ substitution in two-slab perovskite-like structure of BaNd2In2O7 and its effect on the structural features and electroconductive properties of the Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7 indates synthesized. A characterization, including data of X-ray diffraction, structural calculations (Rietveld method) of phases obtained, is presented. Existence region of Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7 solid solutions with a two-slab perovskite-like structure (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.2) was established and their coordinate parameters (x = 0.1 and x = 0.2) are refined. Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7 structure is based on two-dimensional (infinite in the XY plane) perovskite-like blocks of two slabs connected by vertices of deformed InO6 octahedra. Neighbouring blocks are separated by a slab of NdO9 polyhedra and interconnected by O–Nd–O bonds. Correlations between substitution degree of barium atoms and electroconductive properties have been established. It is shown that such type of substitution leads to a decrease in the Nd–O2 interblock bond length (from 0.223(2) nm at x = 0 to 0.214(1) nm at x = 0.2). This brings the constitution of two-dimensional structure of Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7 closer to the structure of three-dimensional perovskite and leads to its destruction at x > 0.2. Increase in the degree of substitution is also accompanied by a gradual decrease in specific conductivity of ceramic grains and increase in the activation energy and their own electrical conductivity.","meta":{"doi":"802866"},"tokens":[[{"start":86,"end":101,"text":"oxide compounds","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":193,"end":195,"text":"Ba","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":213,"end":215,"text":"Sr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":277,"end":287,"text":"BaNd2In2O7","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":239,"end":263,"text":"two-slab perovskite-like","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":310,"end":329,"text":"structural features","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":334,"end":362,"text":"electroconductive properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":370,"end":386,"text":"Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":446,"end":463,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":490,"end":498,"text":"Rietveld","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":601,"end":625,"text":"two-slab perovskite-like","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":561,"end":577,"text":"Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":676,"end":697,"text":"coordinate parameters","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":733,"end":749,"text":"Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":885,"end":889,"text":"InO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":772,"end":830,"text":"two-dimensional (infinite in the XY plane) perovskite-like","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":890,"end":899,"text":"octahedra","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":948,"end":952,"text":"NdO9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":953,"end":962,"text":"polyhedra","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":985,"end":986,"text":"O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":987,"end":989,"text":"Nd","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":990,"end":991,"text":"O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1182,"end":1184,"text":"Nd","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1185,"end":1187,"text":"O2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1327,"end":1343,"text":"Ba1−xSrxNd2In2O7","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1389,"end":1399,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1199,"end":1210,"text":"bond length","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1525,"end":1546,"text":"specific conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1585,"end":1602,"text":"activation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1617,"end":1640,"text":"electrical conductivity","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":11,"created_at":"2022-10-18T11:25:07.441861Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T11:25:07.441861Z","lead_time":3.928}

{"text":"Efficiency enhancement of Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3 solar cell devices was performed by using iso-butyl ammonium iodide (IBA) passivated on Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3 films. The n−i−p structure of perovskite solar cell devices was fabricated with the structure of FTO/SnO2/Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3 (FTO, i.e. fluorine doped tin oxide) and IBA/Spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The effect of different weights of IBA passivated on Cs-doped perovskite solar cells (PSCs) was systematically investigated and compared with non-passivated devices. It was found that the 5-mg IBA-passivated devices exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.49% higher than 12.64% of non-IBA-passivated devices. The improvement of photovoltaic parameters of the 5-mg IBA-passivated device can be clearly observed compared to the Cs-doped device. The better performance of the IBA-passivated device can be confirmed by the reduction of PbI2 phase in the crystal structure, lower charge recombination rate, lower charge transfer resistance, and improved contact angle of perovskite films. Therefore, IBA passivation on Cs0.1(CH3NH)0.9PbI3 is a promising technique to improve the efficiency of Cs-doped perovskite solar cells.","meta":{"doi":"802867"},"tokens":[[{"start":26,"end":46,"text":"Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":47,"end":57,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":89,"end":114,"text":"iso-butyl ammonium iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":116,"end":119,"text":"IBA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":135,"end":155,"text":"Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":253,"end":256,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":257,"end":261,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":262,"end":282,"text":"Cs0.1(CH3NH3)0.9PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":284,"end":287,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":294,"end":302,"text":"fluorine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":309,"end":318,"text":"tin oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":324,"end":327,"text":"IBA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":328,"end":340,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":341,"end":343,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":380,"end":383,"text":"IBA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":186,"end":207,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":407,"end":429,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":431,"end":435,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":578,"end":605,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":607,"end":610,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":691,"end":714,"text":"photovoltaic parameters","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":895,"end":899,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":938,"end":963,"text":"charge recombination rate","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":965,"end":997,"text":"lower charge transfer resistance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1012,"end":1025,"text":"contact angle","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1029,"end":1039,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1040,"end":1045,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1058,"end":1061,"text":"IBA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1077,"end":1096,"text":"Cs0.1(CH3NH)0.9PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1160,"end":1182,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1151,"end":1159,"text":"Cs-doped","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":398,"end":400,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":401,"end":406,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":789,"end":791,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":792,"end":797,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":9,"created_at":"2022-10-18T11:23:27.653632Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T11:23:27.653632Z","lead_time":943.414}

These highlighting disadvantages limit the quality of X-ray detection, and further impede the commercial application of X-ray. Luckily, low-dimensional semiconductors (LD), such as metal halide perovskites, classical inorganic semiconductors, and metal-organic frameworks, etc., possess Quantum well effect and Quantum size effect, emerging as alternative materials to conquer these problems. Moreover, some LD materials show outstanding properties of high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY), superior carrier lifetime produces, tunable bandgap, and low-temperature fabrication process, which ensures them as a competitive selection for X-ray detection. In this book chapter, firstly, the working mechanism and essential parameters of the direct and indirect X-ray detector are introduced. Then, advanced works based on LD semiconductors are systematically presented in both direct and indirect X-ray detection, as well as their application in X-ray imaging.

Herein, we report a facile solution-process method to synthesize the recently most popular lead-free halide double perovskite, MA2AgBiBr6, and its all-inorganic counterpart, Cs2AgBiBr6. The obtained MA2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 films exhibit the microplatelet morphology with excellent crystallinity, distinctly contrasting the ones fabricated by the conventional spin-coating method. Once fabricated into simple photodetectors, the Cs2AgBiBr6 microplatelet devices yield a respectable responsivity of 245 mA W−1 that is two orders of magnitude larger than that of the spin-coated films. More importantly, the response speed of the Cs2AgBiBr6 microplatelets device is as fast as 145 µs, which is higher than most of the values reported in the community of halide double perovskites. When subjected to the thermal stability testing, the Cs2AgBiBr6 microplatelet device can maintain its initial performance after heating to 160°C and cooling down to room temperature in the ambient environment.

Therefore, carbon materials with high electric conductivity and favorable work function are recently being noticed as alternatives to the conventional electrodes since the carbon materials are abundant in nature and low in the fabrication cost. Therefore, carbon electrode for the perovskite optoelectronics is widely studied to replace the conventional electrode, and utilizing carbon as an electrode can be the alternative solution for a future electrode model. In this review, the recent progress of carbon electrodes in perovskite optoelectronics and various applications will be discussed.Title: Recent Progress in Carbon Electrodes for Efficient and Cost-Benign Perovskite Optoelectronics. Keywords: Perovskite Solar Cells, Electrode, Carbon, Cost Engineering, Performance, Stability. Electrodes in the perovskite optoelectronics rely on the metal and oxide-based materials. Carbon is highly conductive and has proper work function of 5.0 eV, which has a potential to replace the conventional vacuum-processed electrodes, such as metal and transparent conducting oxide (TCO). Moreover, carbon electrode allows wide utilizations in flexible, semi-transparent, and large-area devices. Therefore, utilizing carbon as an effective electrode can be the alternative solution for the future electrode model.","meta":{"doi":"803059"},"tokens":[[{"start":23,"end":33,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":34,"end":49,"text":"optoelectronics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":233,"end":243,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":244,"end":259,"text":"optoelectronics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":290,"end":300,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":513,"end":519,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":540,"end":561,"text":"electric conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":576,"end":589,"text":"work function","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":653,"end":663,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":674,"end":680,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":758,"end":764,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":765,"end":774,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":783,"end":793,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":794,"end":809,"text":"optoelectronics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":856,"end":865,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":881,"end":887,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":894,"end":903,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":949,"end":958,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1005,"end":1011,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1012,"end":1022,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1026,"end":1036,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1037,"end":1052,"text":"optoelectronics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1122,"end":1128,"text":"Carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1129,"end":1139,"text":"Electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1170,"end":1180,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1181,"end":1196,"text":"Optoelectronics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1208,"end":1230,"text":"Perovskite Solar Cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1232,"end":1241,"text":"Electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1243,"end":1249,"text":"Carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1282,"end":1291,"text":"Stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1293,"end":1303,"text":"Electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1311,"end":1321,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1322,"end":1337,"text":"optoelectronics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1383,"end":1389,"text":"Carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1426,"end":1439,"text":"work function","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1518,"end":1528,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1594,"end":1600,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1601,"end":1610,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1712,"end":1718,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1735,"end":1744,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1792,"end":1801,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":202,"created_at":"2022-11-02T14:02:07.091186Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T14:02:07.091186Z","lead_time":607.086}
{"text":"Phenol is one of the most toxic and carcinogenic oxygenated organic compounds, which is often found in wastewater of various industries. Therefore, design of efficient phenol degradation method becomes crucial. B-site substitution into perovskite structure generates synergistic effects in its structure which enhances catalytic properties. However, to effectively design an economically feasible process, substitution of cheap and catalytically active B-site metal elements becomes significant. In view of this, three perovskite-type oxides with chemical formula LaM0.5Cu0.5O3 (M = Co, Cr, Fe) were synthesized and characterized in this work. Furthermore, their application in a feasible phenol oxidation process has been reported. The XRD and XPS analysis results demonstrate successful B-site substitution of transition metal elements in perovskite structure. Remarkably high BET surface areas were obtained for all three catalysts (32–47 m2/g). The results of catalytic activity tests constructively reveal that LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3 is superior when compared with the other two catalysts. Highest TOC removal and best catalytic performance was exhibited by all the catalysts at 90 ℃, atmospheric pressure, 1 g/l catalyst loading and 700 rpm stirring speed. The reaction was successfully completed with hydrogen peroxide concentration less than the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction. The order of catalytic activity is LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3 > LaCr0.5Cu0.5O3 > LaFe0.5Cu0.5O3. This order of catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts can be attributed to high amount of lattice oxygen provided by LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3 catalyst, and the same conclusion can be drawn from the XPS analysis. This suggests that excellent catalytic performance can be attained at low costs for phenol oxidation process.","meta":{"doi":"803058"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":6,"text":"Phenol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":168,"end":186,"text":"phenol degradation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":236,"end":246,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":319,"end":339,"text":"catalytic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":519,"end":529,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":564,"end":594,"text":"LaM0.5Cu0.5O3 (M = Co, Cr, Fe)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":689,"end":695,"text":"phenol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":737,"end":740,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":745,"end":748,"text":"XPS","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":841,"end":851,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":879,"end":896,"text":"BET surface areas","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":925,"end":934,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1016,"end":1030,"text":"LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1076,"end":1085,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1163,"end":1172,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1210,"end":1218,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1300,"end":1317,"text":"hydrogen peroxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1430,"end":1444,"text":"LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1464,"end":1478,"text":"LaFe0.5Cu0.5O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1529,"end":1538,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1602,"end":1616,"text":"LaCo0.5Cu0.5O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1617,"end":1625,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1673,"end":1685,"text":"XPS analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1771,"end":1777,"text":"phenol","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":201,"created_at":"2022-11-02T13:51:58.740179Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T13:51:58.740179Z","lead_time":641.544}

{"text":"Perovskite-based ceramic composites were developed as potential waste form materials for immobilizing cesium (Cs) and iodine (I) with high waste loadings and chemical durability. The perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 has high Cs (22 wt%) and I (58 wt%) content, and thus can be used as a potential host phase to immobilize these critical radionuclides. In this work, the perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 phase was synthesized by a cost effective solution-based approach, and was embedded into a highly durable hydroxyapatite matrix by spark plasma sintering to form dense ceramic composite waste forms. The chemical durabilities of the monolithic Cs3Bi2I9 and Cs3Bi2I9-hydroxyapatite composite pellets were investigated by static and semi-dynamic leaching tests, respectively. Cs and I are incongruently released from the matrix for both pure Cs3Bi2I9 and composite structures. The normalized Cs release rate is faster than that of I, which can be explained by the difference in the strengths between Cs−I and Bi−I bonds as well as the formation of insoluble micrometer-sized BiOI precipitates. The activation energies of elemental releases based on dissolution and diffusion-controlled mechanisms are determined with significantly higher energy barriers for dissolution from the composite versus that of the monolithic Cs3Bi2I9. The ceramic-based composite waste forms exhibit excellent chemical durabilities and waste loadings, commensurate with the state-of-the-art glass-bonded perovskite composites for I and Cs immobilization.","meta":{"doi":"803052"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":35,"text":"Perovskite-based ceramic composites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":102,"end":108,"text":"cesium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":110,"end":112,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":118,"end":124,"text":"iodine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":139,"end":153,"text":"waste loadings","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":158,"end":177,"text":"chemical durability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":183,"end":193,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":194,"end":202,"text":"Cs3Bi2I9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":212,"end":215,"text":"Cs ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":126,"end":127,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":228,"end":229,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":357,"end":367,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":368,"end":376,"text":"Cs3Bi2I9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":419,"end":442,"text":"solution-based approach","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":483,"end":497,"text":"hydroxyapatite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":508,"end":530,"text":"spark plasma sintering","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":545,"end":552,"text":"ceramic","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":580,"end":601,"text":"chemical durabilities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":620,"end":628,"text":"Cs3Bi2I9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":633,"end":641,"text":"Cs3Bi2I9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":642,"end":656,"text":"hydroxyapatite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":750,"end":752,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":757,"end":758,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":816,"end":824,"text":"Cs3Bi2I9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":866,"end":868,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":905,"end":906,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":974,"end":976,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":977,"end":978,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":983,"end":985,"text":"Bi","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":986,"end":987,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1049,"end":1053,"text":"BiOI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1481,"end":1482,"text":"I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1487,"end":1489,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":195,"created_at":"2022-11-02T12:26:43.000657Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T12:26:43.000657Z","lead_time":331.341}
{"text":"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are emerging as a promising next-generation photovoltaic device with unprecedented advantages. However, the use of expensive and unstable noble metals as back electrodes seriously limits the large-scale application of PSCs. Modular carbon electrode PSCs (C-PSCs), i.e., the final PSCs were assembled with two individual elements (semi-cell A and charge collector B) under pressure, have been demonstrated as an excellent solution to the serious limitations caused by noble metal electrodes. Modular C-PSCs have been synthesized, where simple spray-coated graphene was used as a carbon electrode and an A-site triple cation mixed composition perovskite Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 as the light-harvesting layer. For comparison, conventional Au electrode PSCs (A-PSCs) were also fabricated using the same perovskite composition. Despite its slightly inferior power conversion efficiency, 18.88% for C-PSCs compared with 19.37% for A-PSCs, the C-PSCs exhibit significantly improved stability compared to the A-PSCs, which was mainly attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the carbon electrode and enhanced photochemical stability due to the incorporation of Cs+ cations. Moreover, models to analyze the photogeneration and carrier transport properties of C-PSCs and A-PSCs have been proposed based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and current density–voltage curve measurements.","meta":{"doi":"803051"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"Perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":24,"end":28,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":74,"end":93,"text":"photovoltaic device","annotation":"APL"},{"start":184,"end":199,"text":"back electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":248,"end":252,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":285,"end":291,"text":"C-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":262,"end":283,"text":"carbon electrode PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":310,"end":314,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":509,"end":519,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":529,"end":535,"text":"C-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":585,"end":593,"text":"graphene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":608,"end":624,"text":"carbon electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":671,"end":681,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":682,"end":722,"text":"Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":730,"end":752,"text":"light-harvesting layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":783,"end":800,"text":"Au electrode PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":802,"end":808,"text":"A-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":972,"end":978,"text":"A-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":984,"end":990,"text":"C-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":940,"end":946,"text":"C-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":900,"end":927,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1048,"end":1054,"text":"A-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1296,"end":1302,"text":"C-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1307,"end":1313,"text":"A-PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1199,"end":1202,"text":"Cs+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1124,"end":1133,"text":"electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1148,"end":1170,"text":"hotochemical stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1244,"end":1259,"text":"photogeneration","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1264,"end":1292,"text":"carrier transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1342,"end":1380,"text":"electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1385,"end":1427,"text":"current density–voltage curve measurements","annotation":"CMT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":194,"created_at":"2022-11-02T12:21:08.757262Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T12:21:08.757262Z","lead_time":351.918}

{"text":"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly developed in the past few years, with a record efficiency exceeding 25%. However, the long-term stability of PSCs remains a challenge and limits their practical application. Many high-performance PSCs have an n-i-p device architecture employing 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) as bi-dopants for the hole-transporting layer (HTL). However, the hygroscopicity of Li-TFSI and low boiling point of t-BP negatively impact the moisture stability of these PSC devices. Herein, we report the use of the fluorine-containing hydrophobic compound tris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphine (35FP) as a dopant for poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA). With better hydrophobicity and stability than undoped PTAA, a PSC device containing 35FP-doped PTAA demonstrated improved charge transport properties and reduced trap density, leading to a significant enhancement in performance. In addition, the long-term stability of a 35FP-doped PTAA PSC under air exposure without encapsulation was demonstrated, with 80% of the initial device efficiency maintained for 1,000 h. This work provides a new approach for the fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs to explore hydrophobic dopants as a substitute for hydrophilic Li-TFSI/t-BP.","meta":{"doi":"803049"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"Perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":24,"end":28,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":139,"end":148,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":152,"end":156,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":239,"end":243,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":252,"end":257,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":288,"end":308,"text":"4-tert-butylpyridine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":310,"end":314,"text":"t-BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":320,"end":365,"text":"bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":367,"end":374,"text":"Li-TFSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":379,"end":389,"text":"bi-dopants","annotation":"APL"},{"start":398,"end":421,"text":"hole-transporting layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":423,"end":426,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":460,"end":467,"text":"Li-TFSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":442,"end":456,"text":"hygroscopicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":493,"end":497,"text":"t-BP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":476,"end":489,"text":"boiling point","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":529,"end":538,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":548,"end":551,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":594,"end":602,"text":"fluorine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":635,"end":667,"text":"tris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":669,"end":673,"text":"35FP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":680,"end":686,"text":"dopant","annotation":"APL"},{"start":691,"end":738,"text":"poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":740,"end":744,"text":"PTAA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":759,"end":773,"text":"hydrophobicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":778,"end":787,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":793,"end":800,"text":"undoped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":801,"end":805,"text":"PTAA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":809,"end":812,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":831,"end":835,"text":"35FP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":836,"end":841,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":842,"end":846,"text":"PTAA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":869,"end":896,"text":"charge transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":909,"end":921,"text":"trap density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1003,"end":1012,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1018,"end":1022,"text":"35FP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1023,"end":1028,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1029,"end":1033,"text":"PTAA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1034,"end":1037,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1241,"end":1245,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1257,"end":1268,"text":"hydrophobic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1269,"end":1276,"text":"dopants","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1297,"end":1308,"text":"hydrophilic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1309,"end":1316,"text":"Li-TFSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1317,"end":1322,"text":"t-BP.","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":192,"created_at":"2022-11-02T12:12:01.025439Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T12:12:01.025439Z","lead_time":364.788}

The lead-free halide double perovskites have versatile applications as photovoltaic, thermoelectric, spintronic, LED, and photocatalytic materials. This article discussed both theoretical and experimental assessments of the optical, electronic, magnetic, and thermoelectric properties of lead-free halide double perovskites. In addition, we have discussed their structural, mechanical, and thermal stabilities of lead-free halide double perovskites with the help of experimental and theoretical data. Furthermore, we have highlighted the up-to-date progress of lead-free halide double perovskites for applications in the field of photovoltaic, field-effect transistor (FET), and light-emitting diode (LED), photocatalyst, thermoelectric, spintronic, and memristors. Finally, challenges and future outlooks for using these materials for said applications are discussed.","meta":{"doi":"803045"},"tokens":[[{"start":21,"end":45,"text":"metal halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":47,"end":51,"text":"MHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":142,"end":152,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":154,"end":177,"text":"Field-Effect Transistor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":179,"end":182,"text":"FET","annotation":"APL"},{"start":189,"end":209,"text":"Light-Emitting Diode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":211,"end":214,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":217,"end":223,"text":"sensor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":225,"end":238,"text":"photocatalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":254,"end":265,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":270,"end":278,"text":"toxicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":377,"end":412,"text":"lead-free halide double perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":457,"end":492,"text":"lead-free halide double perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":566,"end":569,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":575,"end":589,"text":"photocatalytic","annotation":"APL"},{"start":677,"end":684,"text":"optical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":686,"end":696,"text":"electronic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":698,"end":706,"text":"magnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":712,"end":737,"text":"thermoelectric properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":741,"end":776,"text":"lead-free halide double perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":851,"end":862,"text":"stabilities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":866,"end":901,"text":"lead-free halide double perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1014,"end":1049,"text":"lead-free halide double perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1083,"end":1095,"text":"photovoltaic","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1097,"end":1120,"text":"field-effect transistor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1122,"end":1125,"text":"FET","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1133,"end":1152,"text":"ight-emitting diode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1154,"end":1157,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1160,"end":1173,"text":"photocatalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1175,"end":1189,"text":"thermoelectric","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1191,"end":1201,"text":"spintronic","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1207,"end":1217,"text":"memristors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":524,"end":536,"text":"photovoltaic","annotation":"APL"},{"start":538,"end":552,"text":"thermoelectric","annotation":"APL"},{"start":554,"end":564,"text":"spintronic","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":188,"created_at":"2022-11-02T11:48:13.763480Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T11:48:13.763480Z","lead_time":391.491}

{"text":"In this study, an EA-substituted tin based perovskite solar cell with different hole transport material (PEDOT: PSS, Cu2O, CuI, CZTSe) have been investigated using device simulation software. The effects of absorber thickness, defect density, operating temperature, J–V characteristics, and Quantum efficiency have been considered to enhance the performance of the solar cell. To confirm the feasibility and validate the study, all the simulation results were compared with reported experiment data.

{"text":"Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become the front runner among the next-generation thin-film photovoltaic technology due to their rapid great improvements in photovoltaic performance. The improvement of PSCs mainly focuses on their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and ambient stability. α-Fe2O3 has been demostrated as one promising electron transport material in planar n-i-p PSCs, which exhibit much higher ultraviolet (UV) light stability compared to TiO2-based devices. However, both energetic mismatch and numerous hydroxyl species on α-Fe2O3 surface are dentrimental to the charge transfer and collection in PSCs. Herein, we have engineered the α-Fe2O3 electron transport layer (ETL)-perovskite interface via lead iodide (PbI2)-assisted bifunctional modification. The surface hydroxyl groups could be effectively diminished by coordination with PbI2 accompanied with the formation of Fe–O-Pb bonds. It was found that the decreased -OH groups were beneficial to suppressing J-V hysteresis and improving interfacial alignment of energy levels. Meanwhile, numerous intrinsic iodine vacancies at the perovskite crystal surface could be compensated by the excess I− from PbI2, thereby reducing interfacial non-radiative recombination. Consequently, compared with reference devices, α-Fe2O3/PbI2 devices achieved a noticeable improvement of average PCE with attenuated J-V hysteresis. More importantly, α-Fe2O3/PbI2 devices exhibited significantly improved UV and shelf-life stabilities. Furthermore, compared with the CH3NH3PbI3-based device, a higher PCE of 19.32% was achieved for the device assembled with a Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite active layer. Overall, this work provided a facile PbI2-assisted interface modification strategy for boosting the efficiency and stability of α-Fe2O3-based planar PSCs.","meta":{"doi":"803040"},"tokens":[[{"start":25,"end":47,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":49,"end":53,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":110,"end":143,"text":"thin-film photovoltaic technology","annotation":"APL"},{"start":185,"end":209,"text":"photovoltaic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":230,"end":234,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":259,"end":286,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":288,"end":291,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":297,"end":314,"text":"ambient stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":316,"end":323,"text":"α-Fe2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":393,"end":399,"text":"planar","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":406,"end":410,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":362,"end":380,"text":"electron transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":400,"end":405,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":438,"end":470,"text":"ultraviolet (UV) light stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":483,"end":487,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":549,"end":557,"text":"hydroxyl","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":569,"end":576,"text":"α-Fe2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":643,"end":647,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":680,"end":687,"text":"α-Fe2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":688,"end":712,"text":"electron transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":714,"end":717,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":719,"end":729,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":744,"end":755,"text":"lead iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":757,"end":761,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":811,"end":819,"text":"hydroxyl","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":880,"end":884,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":919,"end":921,"text":"Fe","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":924,"end":926,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":966,"end":969,"text":"-OH","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1107,"end":1113,"text":"iodine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1114,"end":1123,"text":"vacancies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1131,"end":1141,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1201,"end":1205,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1312,"end":1319,"text":"α-Fe2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1320,"end":1324,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1378,"end":1381,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1432,"end":1439,"text":"α-Fe2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1440,"end":1444,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1548,"end":1558,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1582,"end":1585,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1641,"end":1681,"text":"Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1682,"end":1692,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1744,"end":1748,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1835,"end":1842,"text":"α-Fe2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1856,"end":1860,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1807,"end":1817,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1822,"end":1831,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":183,"created_at":"2022-11-02T11:16:55.984924Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T11:16:55.984924Z","lead_time":539.845}

{"text":"The molecular approach has been suggested as an effective surface engineering method to improve the optoelectronic performance of the halide perovskite materials. In this manuscript, we employ the data mining method to find appropriate conjugated organic molecules bearing amine terminal groups from the organic crystal database for adsorption onto low-dimensional halide perovskite materials, with the conjugation quantified by the bond length alternation (BLA), which has been widely adopted in crystallography to quantify the molecular conjugation. The proposed candidates with the acceptable conjugation and amine groups are thoroughly investigated via first-principles calculations to understand the detailed interactions between the molecules and the Cs2PbBr4-based perovskite substrate and their impacts on the optoelectronic properties and stability. The present study highlights the quantitative bond length analysis of molecular adsorbates and serves as a theoretical platform of data mining chemical species for perovskite solar cells.","meta":{"doi":"803038"},"tokens":[[{"start":100,"end":126,"text":"optoelectronic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":134,"end":161,"text":"halide perovskite materials","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":349,"end":364,"text":"low-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":365,"end":392,"text":"halide perovskite materials","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":657,"end":686,"text":"first-principles calculations","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":757,"end":765,"text":"Cs2PbBr4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":772,"end":782,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":818,"end":843,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":848,"end":857,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1023,"end":1045,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":181,"created_at":"2022-11-02T11:03:41.063855Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T11:03:41.063855Z","lead_time":261.603}
{"text":"Alternative energy technologies at their current state cannot fully replace the existing fossil fuel-based energy production that has led to a rise in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. CO2 sequestration is a compelling solution to greatly reduce CO2 emissions from sources like fossil fuel-based power plants. Chemical-looping oxygen uncoupling process releases gaseous oxygen for combustion at high temperatures in the fuel reactor. The choice of oxygen carrier material (OCM) is pivotal to the chemical-looping process. In this study, citrate gel technique has been used to prepare the OCMs. A total of 5 (five) perovskites were prepared with varying degree of substitution of general formula La0.6A′0.4B′1-yFeyO3 where y = (0.8, 0.9) including the base LaFeO3. Calcined OCMs were characterized with XRD, SEM and BET analysis. OCMs showed an increase in surface area after oxygen release in a thermogravimetric experiment.

{"text":"While low-dimensional organometal halide perovskites are expected to open up new opportunities for a diverse range of device applications, like in their bulk counterparts, the toxicity of Pb-based halide perovskite materials is a significant concern that hinders their practical use. We recently predicted that lead triiodide (PbI3) columns derived from trimethylsulfonium (TMS) lead triiodide (CH3)3SPbI3 (TMSPbI3) by stripping off TMS ligands should be semimetallic, and additionally ultrahigh negative differential resistance (NDR) can arise from the heterojunction composed of a TMSPbI3 channel sandwiched by PbI3 electrodes. Herein, we computationally explore whether similar material and device characteristics can be obtained from other one-dimensional halide perovskites based on non-Pb metal elements, and in doing so deepen the understanding of their mechanistic origins. First, scanning through several candidate metal halide inorganic frameworks as well as their parental form halide perovskites, we find that the germanium triiodide (GeI3) column also assumes a semimetallic character by avoiding the Peierls distortion. Next, adopting the bundled nanowire GeI3-TMSGeI3-GeI3 junction configuration, we obtain a drastically high peak current density and ultrahigh NDR at room temperature. Furthermore, the robustness and controllability of NDR signals from GeI3-TMSGeI3-GeI3 devices under strain are revealed, establishing its potential for flexible electronics applications. It will be emphasized that, despite the performance metrics notably enhanced over those from the TMSPbI3 case, these device characteristics still arise from the identical quantum hybridization NDR mechanism.","meta":{"doi":"803035"},"tokens":[[{"start":6,"end":21,"text":"low-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":22,"end":52,"text":"organometal halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":188,"end":190,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":311,"end":325,"text":"lead triiodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":327,"end":331,"text":"PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":354,"end":372,"text":"trimethylsulfonium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":374,"end":377,"text":"TMS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":379,"end":393,"text":"lead triiodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":394,"end":405,"text":"(CH3)3SPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":407,"end":414,"text":"TMSPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":433,"end":436,"text":"TMS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":496,"end":528,"text":"negative differential resistance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":530,"end":533,"text":"NDR","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":583,"end":590,"text":"TMSPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":613,"end":617,"text":"PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":618,"end":628,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":744,"end":759,"text":"one-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":760,"end":778,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":197,"end":214,"text":"halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":792,"end":794,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":989,"end":1007,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1026,"end":1045,"text":"germanium triiodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1047,"end":1051,"text":"GeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1170,"end":1174,"text":"GeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1175,"end":1182,"text":"TMSGeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1183,"end":1187,"text":"GeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1276,"end":1279,"text":"NDR","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1161,"end":1169,"text":"nanowire","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1352,"end":1355,"text":"NDR","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1369,"end":1373,"text":"GeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1374,"end":1381,"text":"TMSGeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1382,"end":1386,"text":"GeI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1585,"end":1592,"text":"TMSPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1681,"end":1684,"text":"NDR","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":178,"created_at":"2022-11-02T09:29:42.523226Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T09:29:42.523226Z","lead_time":1049.989}

{"text":"Defect states in perovskite films restrict the interfacial stability and open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. Here, aiming at superior interfacial passivation, we investigate the reconfiguration of perovskite interface by the interaction between a series of quaternary ammonium bromides (QAB) and lead—halide (Pb—X) octahedrons. Bromide—iodide substitution reaction or R4NBr addition reaction may occur on the perovskite surface, which is related to the steric hindrance of quaternary ammonium cations. On this basis, the perovskite surface morphology, band structure, growth orientation and defect states are reconstructed via the R4NBr addition reaction. This ordered lead—halide adduct could effectively repair the imperfect perovskite/hole transportation layer interface to suppress non-radiative recombination and ion migration toward ultralong carrier lifetime surpassing 10 µs. The resulting perovskite solar cells yield the efficiency of 23.89% with steady-state efficiency of 23.70%. The passivated cells can sustain 86% of initial efficiency after 200-h operation, which is attributed to the passivation effect and hydrophobic characteristics.

Consequently, the dissatisfactory electric properties of functional layers pose a serious challenge for maximizing the thermodynamic potential of current density of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

It is uncovered that a small amount of Li+ ions remain in the ETL and doped SnO2 while a large amount of Li+ ions diffuse to SnO2/perovskite interface and into perovskite layer and gradient concentration distribution is spontaneously formed. The Li+ ion doping endows both perovskite and SnO2 layers improved electric properties, which contributes to facilitated carrier transport and extraction. Moreover, the crystallinity and grain size of perovskite films are enhanced after doping. The doped device delivers a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.31% together with improved ambient stability in comparison with the control device (PCE = 19.26%).

In this work, the combination of laser-direct-writing and ion exchange is proposed as an efficient way to fabricate high-definition colorful sensing array with perovskite narrowband photodetector unit as pixel. Under laser irradiation, the photolysis of halocarbon solvent (CHCl3, CH3CH2I, etc) releases the halide ions, which brings the ion exchange and gives rise to slow-varying bandgap in single perovskite photoactive film. This ion exchange can be controlled via laser irradiation time and focus point, thus enabling precisely engineerable bandgap. By optimizing the process, it is successfully applied to develop patterned perovskite narrow blue and green photodetectors array with a high-definition of ∼ 53 ppi.

{"text":"Polymer hole-transport layer (HTL) materials have gained considerable attention because of their solution processability, which is effective for maintaining mechanical flexibility for printing technology in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, these materials have low carrier mobility that is insufficient to transport charge carriers. The doping process is usually employed to overcome this drawback, but it adversely affects the device stability. In this study, a dopant-free P18, which is composed of rigid and coplanar thienylenevinylene and dithienothiophene, is used as a HTL in PSCs. These units consist of thiophene which can coordinate with Pb2+ atoms as Lewis bases in order to suppress charge recombination on the perovskite surface and grain boundary.

Furthermore, the PSC fabricated with the dopant-free P18 can maintain a performance of 60% under the humidity conditions of 70–80% after 200 hours without encapsulation by limiting the hygroscopic dopant in the HTL, which is superior to those fabricated with doped P3HT (25%).

{"text":"The self-assembly process for compatible functional layers of devices is a simple, feasible, and energy-saving strategy. In mesoporous perovskite solar cells (PSCs), compact and scaffold TiO2 films generally function as the hole-blocking and electron-transporting layers, respectively. However, both of these layers are usually generated through a high-temperature annealing process. Here, we deposited TiO2 compact films through a room-temperature self-assembly process as effective hole-blocking layers for PSCs. The thickness of TiO2 compact films can be easily controlled by the deposition time. Through the optimization of TiO2 compact films (80 nm), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of mesoporous PSCs without and with hole conductor layers increases up to 10.66% and 17.95%, respectively.

{"text":"Despite its superior optoelectronic properties, the use of zinc oxide (ZnO) as an electron transport layer (ETL) is limited compared to that of TiO2 and SnO2 due to its chemical instability with perovskite. Although several approaches have been presented to alleviate this instability, the use of all-metal halides has not been reported. In this study, we develop stable ZnO/perovskite interfaces through a single-step post-annealing surface modification. The ZnO surface is modified using ammonium fluoride (NH4F) solutions with different concentrations, thereby optimizing the ETL/perovskite interface to simultaneously reduce the loss and increase the stability while maintaining the photoconversion efficiency. Furthermore, the influence of the fluorine concentration on the physical, chemical, optical, and electrical properties of ZnO thin films is investigated. The photovoltaic performance of the planar perovskite solar cell fabricated using the surface-modified ZnO, as the ETL is nearly three times higher than that of the cell obtained using the control. The proposed technique can serve as a facile and holistic approach to enhance the chemical stability and device performance in photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications, irrespective of the ETL and perovskite materials.Fluorine-induced surface modification passivates surface defects on the ZnO surface, which improves the photovoltaic performance and ZnO/perovskite interface stability","meta":{"doi":"803024"},"tokens":[[{"start":21,"end":46,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":59,"end":69,"text":"zinc oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":71,"end":74,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":82,"end":106,"text":"electron transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":108,"end":111,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":144,"end":148,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":153,"end":157,"text":"SnO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":195,"end":205,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":169,"end":189,"text":"chemical instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":273,"end":284,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":297,"end":314,"text":"all-metal halides","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":371,"end":374,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":375,"end":385,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":407,"end":454,"text":"single-step post-annealing surface modification","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":460,"end":463,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":490,"end":507,"text":"ammonium fluoride","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":509,"end":513,"text":"NH4F","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":579,"end":582,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":583,"end":593,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":655,"end":664,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":687,"end":713,"text":"photoconversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":837,"end":840,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":749,"end":757,"text":"fluorine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":779,"end":787,"text":"physical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":789,"end":797,"text":"chemical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":799,"end":806,"text":"optical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":812,"end":833,"text":"electrical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":873,"end":885,"text":"photovoltaic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":905,"end":933,"text":"planar perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":972,"end":975,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":984,"end":987,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1149,"end":1167,"text":"chemical stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1194,"end":1206,"text":"photovoltaic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1211,"end":1225,"text":"optoelectronic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1260,"end":1263,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1268,"end":1278,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1289,"end":1297,"text":"Fluorine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1361,"end":1364,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1393,"end":1405,"text":"photovoltaic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1422,"end":1425,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1426,"end":1436,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1447,"end":1456,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":167,"created_at":"2022-11-02T01:35:44.544725Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T01:35:44.544725Z","lead_time":358.78}

Sensitive SERS quantification is vital for practical applications, particularly for portable detection of biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleotides. However, few approaches can achieve sensitive and quantitative Raman detection of these most fundamental components in biology. Herein, a noble-metal-free single-atom site on a chip strategy was applied to modify single tungsten atom oxide on a lead halide perovskite, which provides sensitive SERS quantification for various analytes, including rhodamine, tyrosine and cytosine. The single-atom site on a chip can enable quantitative linear SERS responses of rhodamine (10−6−1 mmol L−1), tyrosine (0.06–1 mmol L−1) and cytosine (0.2–45 mmol L−1), respectively, which all achieve record-high enhancement factors among plasmonic-free semiconductors. The experimental test and theoretical simulation both reveal that the enhanced mechanism can be ascribed to the controllable single-atom site, which can not only trap photoinduced electrons from the perovskite substrate but also enhance the highly efficient and quantitative charge transfer to analytes. Furthermore, the label-free strategy of single-atom sites on a chip can be applied in a portable Raman platform to obtain a sensitivity similar to that on a benchtop instrument, which can be readily extended to various biomolecules for low-cost, widely demanded and more precise point-of-care testing or in-vitro detection.","meta":{"doi":"803022"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":33,"text":"Surface enhanced Raman scattering","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":35,"end":39,"text":"SERS","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1164,"end":1174,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":165,"created_at":"2022-11-01T13:32:56.435523Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T13:32:56.435523Z","lead_time":144.483}

{"text":"The remarkable hole transport abilities of copper iodide and ionic transportation abilities of lead iodide help in enhancement of their electrical and catalytic properties. The combination of the two has resulted in a perovskite with excellent catalytic and electrical properties. To improve the aforementioned properties of CuPbI3 perovskite, it was doped with EuO and Eu2O3. CuPbI3 and CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3 perovskites were synthesized using combustion method. Four CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3 perovskites with varying compositions were prepared by doping 10, 20, 30 and 40% of Eu+2 and Eu+3 into CuPbI3 perovskite lattice in equal amounts. The structural and thermal characteristics were analyzed using TG-DTG and XRD analysis techniques. The results obtained from XRD analysis suggest that the degree of crystallization increases with an increase in doping of Eu+2/Eu+3. Also, an increase in other structural parameters such as unit cell volume and crystallite size with doping of Eu+2/Eu+3 indicate potential boost in catalytic properties of the aforementioned perovskites. The TG-DTG analysis results indicate that the CuPbI3 perovskite is more stable at lower temperatures (50–430 °C) while CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3 (10–40%) are more thermally stable in the temperature range of 50–505 °C. Also, the overall weight loss was found to be significantly higher in case of CuPbI3 as compared CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3 as indicated by the TG-DTG analysis results. These enhanced structural and catalytic properties of CuPbI3 perovskite escalate its applicability as photovoltaic cells and catalysts.","meta":{"doi":"803020"},"tokens":[[{"start":15,"end":29,"text":"hole transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":43,"end":56,"text":"copper iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":61,"end":81,"text":"ionic transportation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":95,"end":106,"text":"lead iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":136,"end":146,"text":"electrical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":151,"end":160,"text":"catalytic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":218,"end":228,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":244,"end":253,"text":"catalytic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":258,"end":268,"text":"electrical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":325,"end":331,"text":"CuPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":332,"end":342,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":351,"end":356,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":362,"end":365,"text":"EuO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":370,"end":375,"text":"Eu2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":377,"end":383,"text":"CuPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":406,"end":417,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":441,"end":458,"text":"combustion method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":388,"end":405,"text":"CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":465,"end":482,"text":"CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":483,"end":494,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":538,"end":544,"text":"doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":567,"end":571,"text":"Eu+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":576,"end":580,"text":"Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":586,"end":592,"text":"CuPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":593,"end":603,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":634,"end":644,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":649,"end":672,"text":"thermal characteristics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":693,"end":699,"text":"TG-DTG","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":704,"end":707,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":755,"end":758,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":795,"end":810,"text":"crystallization","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":841,"end":847,"text":"doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":851,"end":855,"text":"Eu+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":856,"end":860,"text":"Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":940,"end":956,"text":"crystallite size","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":919,"end":935,"text":"unit cell volume","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":972,"end":976,"text":"Eu+2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":977,"end":981,"text":"Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":962,"end":968,"text":"doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1010,"end":1030,"text":"catalytic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1053,"end":1064,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1070,"end":1076,"text":"TG-DTG","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1112,"end":1118,"text":"CuPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1119,"end":1129,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1185,"end":1202,"text":"CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1355,"end":1361,"text":"CuPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1374,"end":1391,"text":"CuPbI3: Eu+2/Eu+3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1412,"end":1418,"text":"TG-DTG","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1491,"end":1497,"text":"CuPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1452,"end":1462,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1467,"end":1487,"text":"catalytic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1498,"end":1508,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1539,"end":1557,"text":"photovoltaic cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1562,"end":1571,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":163,"created_at":"2022-11-01T13:04:32.146110Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T13:04:32.146110Z","lead_time":496.985}
{"text":"Due to their diverse and tunable composition, distorted lattice and excellent stability, high-entropy ceramics (HECs) hold great promise for catalysis, especially when they present as nanoparticles (NPs). However, current HECs are typically limited to bulky materials with none or fewer defects, because high synthetic temperature (e.g., 1,000–1,200 °C) is usually required to highlight the entropic contribution (TΔS) in ΔG = ΔH − TΔS. Being different with previous strategies, a negative Gibbs free energy for HECs crystallization is obtained by dramatically decreasing the mixing enthalpy (ΔH). Guided by this principle, single-phase high-entropy La(Ni0.2Mn0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Co0.2)O3−δ perovskite (HE-LMO) NPs were prepared at a relatively low temperature (≤ 500 °C). Interestingly, abundant oxygen vacancies were directly created within HE-LMO NPs, which exhibited good activity in catalytic oxidation. Meanwhile, the high-entropy structure endows as-made HE-LMO with robust stability even with 5 vol.% water in feeding gas. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the defective sites in HE-LMO NPs facilitated the charge transfer from HE-LMO to CO, thus activating the adsorbed CO gas. The current work may inspire future design and synthesis of HECs NPs.","meta":{"doi":"803019"},"tokens":[[{"start":141,"end":150,"text":"catalysis","annotation":"APL"},{"start":184,"end":197,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":199,"end":202,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":89,"end":110,"text":"high-entropy ceramics","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":112,"end":116,"text":"HECs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":222,"end":226,"text":"HECs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":517,"end":532,"text":"crystallization","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":512,"end":516,"text":"HECs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":490,"end":507,"text":"Gibbs free energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":642,"end":649,"text":"entropy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":650,"end":683,"text":"La(Ni0.2Mn0.2Cu0.2Fe0.2Co0.2)O3−δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":684,"end":694,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":704,"end":707,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":790,"end":806,"text":"oxygen vacancies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":843,"end":846,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":922,"end":929,"text":"entropy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":974,"end":983,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1024,"end":1049,"text":"Density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1051,"end":1054,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1113,"end":1116,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1164,"end":1166,"text":"CO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1197,"end":1199,"text":"CO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1270,"end":1273,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":162,"created_at":"2022-11-01T12:55:52.943607Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T12:55:52.943607Z","lead_time":1477.385}

{"text":"The current review paper presents a detailed comparative analysis for advantages of using alternative resources like inorganic, organic, natural and perovskite dye-synthesized solar cells as replacement of the traditional semiconductor-based solar cells. To explain the uses of dyes in solar cells, the structural and operational principles of DSSCs along with their several components: photoanode, transparent conducting substrate, electrolyte, sensitizer dye, counter electrode, are also explained. Current advances in inorganic, organic, natural and perovskite-based DSSCs are explained in detail to overview the challenges regarding their efficiencies. Although many literatures are available on DSSCs, this review article covers four types of dyes, namely inorganic, organic, natural and perovskite-based dyes, and recommends the future prospects of DSSCs as an alternative source of energy with low-cost, eco-friendly nature and high efficiency. First, it is shown that inorganic dyes were found as an alternative to replace silicon-based solar cells, while organic dyes have also been found with comparable efficiency. Besides the perovskite-based DSSC is the most efficient with claimed efficiency of 28% in 2020, it is not commercialized as involves adverse impact on environment and is moisture-sensitive. Therefore, more researches are required to improve the efficiency of natural dyes as they exhibit many advantages, and can be the best renewable energy resource. In addition, on comparison of our outcomes with the already reported data by other investigators, some insights are drawn. This updated review article would eminently assist the investigators working in this field to intend the natural dyes in designing DSSCs, in near future.","meta":{"doi":"803015"},"tokens":[[{"start":149,"end":159,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":176,"end":187,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":222,"end":235,"text":"semiconductor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":242,"end":253,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":286,"end":297,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":344,"end":349,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":387,"end":397,"text":"photoanode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":399,"end":431,"text":"transparent conducting substrate","annotation":"APL"},{"start":433,"end":444,"text":"electrolyte","annotation":"APL"},{"start":446,"end":460,"text":"sensitizer dye","annotation":"APL"},{"start":462,"end":479,"text":"counter electrode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":553,"end":563,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":570,"end":575,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":700,"end":705,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":793,"end":803,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":855,"end":860,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":940,"end":950,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1031,"end":1038,"text":"silicon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1045,"end":1056,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1114,"end":1124,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1138,"end":1148,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1155,"end":1159,"text":"DSSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1732,"end":1737,"text":"DSSCs","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":158,"created_at":"2022-11-01T12:07:23.355420Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T12:07:23.355420Z","lead_time":371.001}
{"text":"The deep-level traps at grain boundaries (GBs) and halide ion migration are quite challenging for further enhancement of the stability and efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as well as for the elimination of notorious hysteresis. Herein, we report a large-sized strongly coordinated organic anion GB anchoring strategy for suppressing ion migration and passivating defects in planar PSCs. The practical implementation of this strategy involves the incorporation of potassium salts containing a large-sized organic counter anion (4-sulfobenzoic acid monopotassium salt, SAMS) into the perovskite precursor. It has been found that anions within SAMS can be firmly anchored at GBs due to the strong coordination interaction between C=O and/or S=O at both ends of bulky anion and undercoordinated Pb2+ and/or halide vacancies, along with the hydrogen bond between −OH and formamidinium. SAMS can not only passivate shallow-level defects but also cause more effective passivation of the deep-level defects. The GB manipulation strategy results in a reduced defect density, an increased carrier lifetime as well as suppressed ion migration, which in turn contributed to enhanced efficiency and stability of PSCs together with a thorough elimination of hysteresis. As a result, the SAMS-modified device with an outstanding fill factor of 0.84 delivers a significant improvement in efficiency (22.7%) in comparison with the control device (20.3%). The unencapsulated modified device demonstrates only little degradation after 1320 h at 60°C.","meta":{"doi":"803014"},"tokens":[[{"start":153,"end":175,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":177,"end":181,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":24,"end":40,"text":"grain boundaries","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":42,"end":45,"text":"GBs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":306,"end":308,"text":"GB","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":125,"end":134,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":139,"end":150,"text":"efficiency ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":392,"end":396,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":344,"end":357,"text":"ion migration","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":58,"end":71,"text":"ion migration","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":538,"end":576,"text":"4-sulfobenzoic acid monopotassium salt","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":578,"end":582,"text":"SAMS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":593,"end":603,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":474,"end":483,"text":"potassium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":652,"end":656,"text":"SAMS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":683,"end":686,"text":"GBs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":802,"end":806,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":869,"end":872,"text":"−OH","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":877,"end":890,"text":"formamidinium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":892,"end":896,"text":"SAMS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":4,"end":20,"text":"deep-level traps","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":991,"end":1009,"text":"deep-level defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1015,"end":1017,"text":"GB","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1182,"end":1192,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1197,"end":1206,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1210,"end":1214,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1284,"end":1288,"text":"SAMS","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":157,"created_at":"2022-11-01T12:00:30.135570Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T12:00:30.135570Z","lead_time":643.467}
{"text":"Photocatalytic, magnetic and antimicrobial properties of barium zirconate (BaZrO3) perovskite green synthesized using Plectranthus amboinicus (P. amboinicus) and Ocimum sanctum (O. sanctum) leaf extracts has been summarized here. Confirmation of cubic structure with (1 1 0) preferential growth has been arrived from the XRD studies. The occupancy of magnetic metal ions such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn2+ and Co2+ on the octahedral A and B sites makes P. amboinicus and O. sanctum leaf extract–mediated BaZrO3 paramagnetic and ferromagnetic, respectively. Antimicrobial studies performed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria justifies that the green synthesized samples exhibited good inhibition on its growth.

{"text":"The development of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for promoting solar-driven oxygen (O2) production from water splitting is a potentially attractive but still a challenging scheme. In the present work, a (111)-type layered perovskite oxynitride, Sr5Nb4O15−xNx, was synthesized via the nitridation treatment of the disk-like oxide precursor under the ammonia flow, which was fabricated using a flux method. The homogeneous dispersion of nitrogen (N) dopant in N-doped Sr5Nb4O15 was ascertained by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy characterization, and the Sr5Nb4O15−xNx was found to be a direct semiconductor with a light absorption edge of approximately 640 nm. Density functional theory investigation implies that the hybridization between the outmost N 2p orbitals and O 2p orbitals upshifts the original valence band maximum of Sr5Nb4O15 and endows its visible-light-responsive characteristics. Loading with cobalt oxide (CoOx) as cocatalyst, the as-prepared Sr5Nb4O15−xNx exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic O2 evolution activity from water splitting under visible-light illumination (λ > 420 nm). Moreover, another homogeneous N-doped layered perovskite-type niobium (Nb)-based oxynitride, Ba5Nb4O15−xNx, was also developed and investigated for the visible-light-actuated O2 production, highlighting the versatility of the present approach for exploring novel visible-light-responsive photocatalysts.","meta":{"doi":"803012"},"tokens":[[{"start":19,"end":58,"text":"visible-light-responsive photocatalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":86,"end":92,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":94,"end":96,"text":"O2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":232,"end":242,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":224,"end":231,"text":"layered","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":213,"end":223,"text":"(111)-type","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":243,"end":253,"text":"oxynitride","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":255,"end":268,"text":"Sr5Nb4O15−xNx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":402,"end":413,"text":"flux method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":359,"end":366,"text":"ammonia","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":445,"end":453,"text":"nitrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":455,"end":456,"text":"N","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":468,"end":469,"text":"N","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":470,"end":475,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":476,"end":485,"text":"Sr5Nb4O15","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":505,"end":541,"text":"energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":568,"end":581,"text":"Sr5Nb4O15−xNx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":607,"end":620,"text":"semiconductor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":675,"end":700,"text":"Density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":766,"end":767,"text":"N","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":784,"end":785,"text":"O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":820,"end":832,"text":"valence band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":844,"end":853,"text":"Sr5Nb4O15","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":924,"end":936,"text":"cobalt oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":938,"end":942,"text":"CoOx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":975,"end":988,"text":"Sr5Nb4O15−xNx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1011,"end":1047,"text":"photocatalytic O2 evolution activity","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1146,"end":1147,"text":"N","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1148,"end":1153,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1154,"end":1161,"text":"layered","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1162,"end":1172,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1178,"end":1185,"text":"niobium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1187,"end":1189,"text":"Nb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1191,"end":1196,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1197,"end":1207,"text":"oxynitride","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1209,"end":1222,"text":"Ba5Nb4O15−xNx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1291,"end":1293,"text":"O2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1379,"end":1418,"text":"visible-light-responsive photocatalysts","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":155,"created_at":"2022-10-29T04:37:46.834220Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T04:37:46.835220Z","lead_time":456.991}

{"text":"Perovskite appears to be the most promising candidate for thin-film solar cells due to its excellent optoelectronic properties, low-cost fabrication, and high photovoltaic performance. However, tin-based perovskite solar cells possess few issues related to thermal instability and poor performance. A study on thermal instability will be important to know the inner mechanism of the device. To find out the cause of thermal instability, a study on the temperature coefficient of different electrical and photovoltaic parameters is necessary. In this work, the effect of temperature on electrical and photovoltaic parameters of lead-free tin-based perovskite solar cells having ITO/ETL/CH3NH3SnI3/HTL architecture has been studied using a SCAPS-1D simulator. The coefficients of the temperature of these parameters have been calculated. Titanium dioxide has been used as the electron transport layer and Spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transport layer. The dark current–voltage analysis shows the positive temperature coefficient of barrier height and negative temperature coefficient of ideality factor. The estimated values of absolute temperature coefficient of barrier height and ideality factor are 170 μeV per K and 0.0017 per K, respectively. The light current–voltage (J-V) analysis shows negative temperature coefficients for all photovoltaic parameters. The absolute temperature coefficient of open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency is 1.6 mV per K, 9 μA/cm2 per K, 0.031 per K, and 0.074 per K, respectively. This study reveals the temperature sensitiveness of lead-free tin-based perovskite solar cells.

{"text":"The Scaps-1d simulator was used to simulate a lead-free perovskite CH3NH3SnI3 based solar cell devices fabricated from different hole transport materials (HTM). This research looks at two organic and two inorganic HTM layers. The cell structure used in this study is FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3SnI3/HTM (variable)/Au(variable). Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:PSS, CuO and Cu2O are the HTM materials used. The results show that utilizing CuO as an HTM produces better outcomes than other HTMs, with an efficiency of 28.45%. The thickness, acceptor concentration (NA), and defect density (Nt) of the perovskite layer on optoelectronic properties of the solar cell are focus of simulation studies. According to this study, an perovskite layer thickness of 1000 nm is suitable for a decent photovoltaic cell. Furthermore, by adjusting the HTM thickness and the defect density of HTM and absorber layer, promising findings of Jsc of 34.38 mAcm−2, Voc of 1.011 V, FF of 80.85% and PCE of 28.10% were obtained for Spiro-OMeTAD based PSC. Finally, in order to improve the device's performance, an anode material with high work function is required. Our findings reveal that using a thin absorber layer results in low photo generated charge carriers due to less absorption, but high carrier extraction. Although more carriers are created in the cell due to increased absorption, decreased collection efficiency is related to recombination, which decreases Voc for thick perovskite layers. Device efficiency is improved by increasing the doping density up to 1018 cm−3 in the perovskite layer due to built-in electric field across the solar cell. Again a very thin or thick HTL is not ideal for high PCE. For low recombination and a high fill factor, an HTM (Spiro-OMeTAD) of 1–100 nm is necessary. The great power conversion efficiency of organic HTM based lead-free PSC brings up the new possibilities for obtaining renewable energy.","meta":{"doi":"803008"},"tokens":[[{"start":4,"end":22,"text":"Scaps-1d simulator","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":46,"end":50,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":51,"end":55,"text":"free","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":56,"end":66,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":67,"end":77,"text":"CH3NH3SnI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":84,"end":94,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":129,"end":153,"text":"hole transport materials","annotation":"APL"},{"start":155,"end":158,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":214,"end":217,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":267,"end":270,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":271,"end":275,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":276,"end":286,"text":"CH3NH3SnI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":302,"end":304,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":316,"end":328,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":330,"end":339,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":341,"end":344,"text":"CuO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":349,"end":353,"text":"Cu2O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":414,"end":417,"text":"CuO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":424,"end":427,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":464,"end":468,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":504,"end":513,"text":"thickness","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":515,"end":537,"text":"acceptor concentration","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":548,"end":562,"text":"defect density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":575,"end":585,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":595,"end":620,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":586,"end":591,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":628,"end":638,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":700,"end":710,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":711,"end":716,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":763,"end":780,"text":"photovoltaic cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":812,"end":815,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":852,"end":855,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":898,"end":901,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":919,"end":922,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":952,"end":955,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":935,"end":937,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":984,"end":996,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1003,"end":1006,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1202,"end":1217,"text":"charge carriers","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1424,"end":1427,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1438,"end":1448,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1543,"end":1553,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1554,"end":1559,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1449,"end":1455,"text":"layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1602,"end":1612,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1667,"end":1670,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1641,"end":1644,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1726,"end":1738,"text":"Spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1721,"end":1724,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1815,"end":1818,"text":"HTM","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1825,"end":1829,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1830,"end":1834,"text":"free","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1835,"end":1838,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":151,"created_at":"2022-10-29T04:12:03.585886Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T04:12:03.585886Z","lead_time":3296.551}
{"text":"This paper reports on the luminescence response and ellipsometry characteristics of the Mn trivalent ion affected by the impact of titanium in the La0.67Ba0.25Ca0.08Mn1-xTixO3 (LBCM1-xTx) (x = 0 or 0.05) sample obtained via a Molten Salt process. In fact, the Rietveld technique of the X-ray data prove a rhombohedral structure (R¯3c) at ambient temperature of the investigated compounds. The photoluminescence properties revealed that two investigated compounds give to the blue photoemissions under laser excitation 360 nm at temperature interval between 10 and 300 K. This result suggests that the luminescence source is only from Mn4+ ion.

Moreover, the optical characteristics at room temperature were examined utilizing spectroscopic ellipsometry, which indicates that the refractive index and extinction factor are in perfect accordance with those variables in the literature.

{"text":"Lead-free bismuth-based halide perovskites and their analogues have attracted research interest for their high stability and optoelectronic properties. However, the morphology-controlled synthesis of bismuth-based perovskite nanocrystals has been rarely demonstrated. Herein, we report the colloidal synthesis of zero-dimensional (0D) Cs3BiCl6 nanosheets (NSs), Cs3Bi2Cl9 NSs/nanoplates (NPs) and Cs4MnBi2Cl12 NPs through a hot-injection method. We demonstrate that the Cs3BiCl6 NSs, as an initial product of Cs3Bi2Cl9 and Cs4MnBi2Cl12 NPs, can transform into Cs3Bi2Cl9 NSs or Cs4MnBi2Cl12 NPs via Cl-induced metal ion insertion reactions under the templating effect of Cs3BiCl6. This growth mechanism is also applicable for the synthesis of Cs4CdBi2Cl12 nanoplates. Furthermore, the alloying of Cd2+ into Cs4MnBi2Cl12 lattice could weaken the strong coupling effect between Mn and Mn, which leads to a prolonged photoluminescence lifetime and an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). As a proof of concept, the alloyed Cs4MnxCd1−xBi2Cl12 NPs are used as a scintillator, which show a lowest detection limit of 134.5 nGy/s. The X-ray imaging results display a high spatial resolution of over 20 line pairs per millimeter (lp/mm). These results provide new insights in the synthesis of anisotropic bismuth-based perovskite nanocrystals and their applications in radiation detection.","meta":{"doi":"803006"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":4,"text":"Lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":5,"end":9,"text":"free","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":10,"end":17,"text":"bismuth","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":18,"end":23,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":24,"end":42,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":111,"end":120,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":125,"end":150,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":200,"end":207,"text":"bismuth","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":208,"end":213,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":214,"end":224,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":225,"end":237,"text":"nanocrystals","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":313,"end":329,"text":"zero-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":331,"end":333,"text":"0D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":335,"end":343,"text":"Cs3BiCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":344,"end":354,"text":"nanosheets","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":356,"end":359,"text":"NSs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":362,"end":371,"text":"Cs3Bi2Cl9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":372,"end":375,"text":"NSs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":376,"end":386,"text":"nanoplates","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":388,"end":391,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":397,"end":409,"text":"Cs4MnBi2Cl12","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":410,"end":413,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":424,"end":444,"text":"hot-injection method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":470,"end":478,"text":"Cs3BiCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":479,"end":482,"text":"NSs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":509,"end":518,"text":"Cs3Bi2Cl9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":523,"end":535,"text":"Cs4MnBi2Cl12","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":536,"end":539,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":560,"end":569,"text":"Cs3Bi2Cl9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":570,"end":573,"text":"NSs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":577,"end":589,"text":"Cs4MnBi2Cl12","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":590,"end":593,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":598,"end":600,"text":"Cl","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":670,"end":678,"text":"Cs3BiCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":742,"end":754,"text":"Cs4CdBi2Cl12","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":755,"end":765,"text":"nanoplates","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":796,"end":800,"text":"Cd2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":806,"end":818,"text":"Cs4MnBi2Cl12","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":851,"end":866,"text":"coupling effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":875,"end":877,"text":"Mn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":882,"end":884,"text":"Mn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":956,"end":987,"text":"photoluminescence quantum yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":989,"end":993,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1031,"end":1049,"text":"Cs4MnxCd1−xBi2Cl12","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1050,"end":1053,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1138,"end":1151,"text":"X-ray imaging","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1307,"end":1314,"text":"bismuth","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1321,"end":1331,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1332,"end":1344,"text":"nanocrystals","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1371,"end":1390,"text":"radiation detection","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":149,"created_at":"2022-10-29T03:12:38.196684Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T03:12:38.196684Z","lead_time":442.199}
{"text":"BackgroundOptimization of adsorption processes using statistical methods of experiment for the removal of pollutants from wastewater, in an effort to curb the global problem of water pollution, is increasingly being adopted because it is cost-effective and time-saving. In most cases, standard central composite designs (CCDs) are often employed for the optimization processes, where the experimental variables are often randomized completely. However, most experiments especially within the industries often involve factors with some hard-to-change (HTC) levels and some with easy-to-change (ETC) levels, in which case the HTC factor cannot be completely randomized, and this challenge can only be overcome by the use of a split-plot CCD. However, there is scarcity of  literature on the use of split-plot CCD for the optimization of adsorption processes, and hence in this study, the prime conditions for the removal of phenol onto BiFeO3 from synthetic wastewater were studied. The effect of three adsorption variables (pH, adsorbent dosage, and shaking time) was investigated using split-plot CCD. pH was considered as the HTC factor due to the amount of time, acid and/or base required to change it, while the adsorbent dosage and contact time were the ETC factors. Quadratic model was developed for the phenol percentage removal.ResultsThe optimum adsorption conditions obtained from the study were adsorbent dosage of 0.60 g, pH of 7 as well as contact time of 167 min with desirability of 1. The predicted and experimental values obtained were 89.73 and 89.21%, showing good agreement between the experimental value and those predicted by the quadratic model. Langmuir isotherm model was found to be the best fit for the equilibrium adsorption data giving rise to monolayer adsorption capacity of 106.50 mg/g. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model’s correlation coefficient (R2) was higher than that of the pseudo-second-order kinetic suggesting the applicability of the model to the adsorption of phenol.ConclusionsThe synthesized BiFeO3 could be considered as a viable alternative to the expensive commercial activated carbon for the removal of phenols in wastewater, and the use of split-plot CCD model makes the experiment much easier to run and save time and/or cost due to fewer number of runs and restriction in the randomization of HTC factors.","meta":{"doi":"803005"},"tokens":[[{"start":294,"end":319,"text":"central composite designs","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":321,"end":325,"text":"CCDs","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":724,"end":738,"text":"split-plot CCD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":796,"end":810,"text":"split-plot CCD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":934,"end":940,"text":"BiFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1086,"end":1100,"text":"split-plot CCD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":922,"end":928,"text":"phenol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2040,"end":2046,"text":"BiFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2193,"end":2207,"text":"split-plot CCD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":2006,"end":2012,"text":"phenol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1309,"end":1315,"text":"phenol","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":148,"created_at":"2022-10-29T03:05:14.754503Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T03:05:14.754503Z","lead_time":346.27}

Recently, excellent advances in the performance of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), especially those with quasi-2D and QD architectures, have been demonstrated with the incorporation of organic chain ligands. Ligands can both modify the structure of PeLEDs, such as forming multi-quantum wells in quasi-2D PeLEDs and essential passivation layers in QD PeLEDs, and also enhance their optical performance. The appropriate use of ligands in PeLEDs can thus lead to greater luminescence, current efficiency, power efficiency, and external quantum efficiency. In this review, the principal roles of ligands in quasi-2D and QD PeLEDs are systematically summarized.

{"text":"A light-harvesting effect was successfully achieved in photovoltaic devices by the structuring of an active perovskite layer through nanoimprinting. This was done by transforming a commercial CD-R pattern into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film. The latter was then used for replicating the perovskite layers under increased pressures and temperatures. The Young’s modulus of the PDMS film was regulated by the mixing ratio of the base and curing agents, and the average height of the pattern was reported for an optimal 5:1 base-to-curing agent ratio. Under these conditions, the replication efficiency reached 80% at a pressure of ~ 4.9 kPa. To investigate the manner in which the structuring of these patterned perovskite layers affects optoelectronic devices, we incorporated them into photovoltaic cells.

The compactness and crystal size of the perovskite film were significantly improved after incorporating CdxSn(1−x)S alloy into the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) solution to form the MAPI/CdxSn(1−x)S precursor solution. Furthermore, the charge transfer of resulting PSCs is observably improved.

{"text":"This work aims to establish the role of synthesis parameters, such as temperature, time, and the Cs/Pb ratio, in the formation of CsPbBr3 perovskite orthorhombic phase. This was done by engaging the hydrothermal method, in which simple Cs and Pb salt precursors were dissolved in water and HBr acted as the Br source. For the Cs/Pb/Br stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:3, only pure tetragonal CsPb2Br5 phase resulted at various synthesis temperatures (150–240°C) and dwell-time of 2–10 h. Interestingly, at a high feed ratio of Cs with a Cs/Pb ratio of 2:1, the final composition had the major tetragonal CsPb2Br5 with minor orthorhombic CsPbBr3 , whereas, at a Cs/Pb ratio of 5:1, the composition had a major orthorhombic CsPbBr3 phase and minor tetragonal CsPb2Br5. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data was carried out for the Cs/Pb ratios of 1:1, 2:1, and 5:1, and their respective crystallographic parameters along with phase fractions (%) were estimated. From the Rietveld refinement, the phase fraction of CsPbBr3 and CsPb2Br5 was estimated to be 31.3 ± 1.9% and 68.6 ± 2% for a 2:1 composition, whereas it was estimated to be 84.4 ± 1.4% and 15.5 ± 0.5% for a 5:1 composition. Williamson–Hall plot analysis was carried out for all the synthesized compositions, and the crystallite size values were evaluated. Scanning electron micrographs were recorded for all the Cs/Pb compositions to ascertain the nature of the microstructure. UV–visible absorption studies on stoichiometric 1:1 compositions showed absorption peaks due to CsPb2Br5 around 286 nm and 331 nm. The UV–visible absorption spectrum recorded for the off-stoichiometric composition of 2:1 exhibited absorption peaks around 377 nm and 398 nm. Further, the UV–visible absorption spectra of composition Cs/Pb ratio of 5:1 comprised an absorption around 500 nm in addition to the peaks about 286 nm and 331 nm, mainly due to the presence of CsPbBr3. Further, photoluminescence spectra were recorded for all the compositions studied and, notably, the 5:1 composition showed an emission peak around 531 nm, primarily attributed to the orthorhombic CsPbBr3. The optical band gap was estimated for all the Cs/Pb compositions by employing Kubelka–Munk plots (αhν)2 versus energy (eV). The mechanism for the formation of the non-perovskite phase in the stoichiometric case (1:1), and then the gradual increase in the constitution of the perovskite phase obtained for the Cs-rich compositions (2:1 and 5:1) are discussed.","meta":{"doi":"802998"},"tokens":[[{"start":97,"end":99,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":100,"end":102,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":130,"end":137,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":138,"end":148,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":149,"end":161,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":199,"end":218,"text":"hydrothermal method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":236,"end":238,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":243,"end":245,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":290,"end":293,"text":"HBr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":307,"end":309,"text":"Br","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":326,"end":328,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":329,"end":331,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":332,"end":334,"text":"Br","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":387,"end":395,"text":"CsPb2Br5","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":422,"end":444,"text":"synthesis temperatures","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":461,"end":471,"text":"dwell-time","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":522,"end":524,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":532,"end":534,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":535,"end":537,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":599,"end":607,"text":"CsPb2Br5","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":632,"end":639,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":619,"end":631,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":656,"end":658,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":659,"end":661,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":717,"end":724,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":704,"end":716,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":741,"end":751,"text":"tetragonal","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":752,"end":760,"text":"CsPb2Br5","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":789,"end":792,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":822,"end":824,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":825,"end":827,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":878,"end":905,"text":"crystallographic parameters","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":962,"end":981,"text":"Rietveld refinement","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1005,"end":1012,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1017,"end":1025,"text":"CsPb2Br5","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1177,"end":1206,"text":"Williamson–Hall plot analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1269,"end":1285,"text":"crystallite size","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1309,"end":1338,"text":"Scanning electron micrographs","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1365,"end":1367,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1368,"end":1370,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1431,"end":1460,"text":"UV–visible absorption studies","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1527,"end":1535,"text":"CsPb2Br5","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1566,"end":1596,"text":"UV–visible absorption spectrum","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1718,"end":1747,"text":"UV–visible absorption spectra","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1763,"end":1765,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1766,"end":1768,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1900,"end":1907,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1918,"end":1943,"text":"photoluminescence spectra","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":2092,"end":2104,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":2105,"end":2112,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2126,"end":2134,"text":"band gap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2161,"end":2163,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2164,"end":2166,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2193,"end":2211,"text":"Kubelka–Munk plots","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":2278,"end":2292,"text":"non-perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":2390,"end":2400,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":2424,"end":2426,"text":"Cs","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":141,"created_at":"2022-10-29T02:36:57.553741Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T02:36:57.553741Z","lead_time":403.968}
{"text":"We report the design of a nanophotonic metal-oxide front contact aimed at perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to enhance optoelectronic properties and device stability in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) light.

As a means, the influence of the Cr content on the film and device was systematically determined. In-depth device optics and electrical effects were studied using advanced three-dimensional opto-electrical multiphysics rigorous simulations, optimizing the front contact for realizing high performance.

Finally, a realistic front contact of nanophotonic architecture was proposed while improving broadband light absorption of the solar spectrum and light harvesting, resulting in enhanced quantum efficiency (QE). The nanophotonic PSC enables JSC improvement by ∼17% while reducing the reflection by 12%, resulting in an estimated conversion efficiency over 23%. It is further demonstrated how the PSCs’ UV-stability can be improved without considerably sacrificing optoelectronic performances.

Although BaCeO3- and BaZrO3-based complex oxides have been positioned as the most promising PCFC electrolytes, the design of new protonic conductors with improved properties is of paramount importance. Within the present work, we studied transport properties of scandium-doped barium stannate (Sc-doped BaSnO3). Our analysis included the fabrication of porous and dense BaSn1−xScxO3−δ ceramic materials (0 ⩽ x ⩽ 0.37), as well as a comprehensive analysis of their total, ionic, and electronic conductivities across all the experimental conditions realized under the PCFC operation: both air and hydrogen atmospheres with various water vapor partial pressures (p(H2O)), and a temperature range of 500–900 °C. This work reports on electrolyte domain boundaries of the undoped and doped BaSnO3 for the first time, revealing that pure BaSnO3 exhibits mixed ionic-electronic conduction behavior under both oxidizing and reducing conditions, while the Sc-doping results in the gradual improvement of ionic (including protonic) conductivity, extending the electrolyte domain boundaries towards reduced atmospheres.

In this review, we primarily summarize the recent development of lead-substitution strategies, which focus on the commonalities and differences of their functionalities that are induced by various doped ions. After a brief introduction to the synthesis, nucleation and growth of all-inorganic LHP NCs, a deep discussion of the crystalline structure, electronic band structure, defect states, exciton binding energy, exciton photodynamic process and stability is followed. Specifically, we highlight the importance of both theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations to establish indicative guidelines for high-performance semiconductor nanomaterials.

{"text":"To realize the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), it is required to overcome the remaining challenges in device enlargement and operational stability. Here, we report an all-in-one strategy by integrating the oxidation of hole-transport material (HTM) with the formation of the passivation layer, which simultaneously solved the stability issues caused by HTM oxidation and realized the uniform defects in passivation over a large area. The resulting devices achieved a certified PCE of 23.12% on average with an aperture area of 1.04 cm2 and are reproducible with high operational stability because of the exclusion of air exposure, hygroscopic Li-TFSI, and the lithium-based wastes, maintaining ca. 90% of their initial PCEs after operation at the maximum power point under continuous 1 sun illumination for 1,600 h.

{"text":"Anti-perovskites A3SnO (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) are an important class of materials due to the emergence of Dirac cones and tiny mass gaps in their band structures originating from an intricate interplay of crystal symmetry, spin-orbit coupling, and band overlap. This provides an exciting playground for modulating their electronic properties in the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Herein, we employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations by combining dispersion-corrected SCAN + rVV10 and mBJ functionals for a comprehensive side-by-side comparison of the structural, thermodynamic, dynamical, mechanical, electronic, and thermoelectric properties of bulk and monolayer (one unit cell thick) A3SnO anti-perovskites. Our results show that 2D monolayers derived from bulk A3SnO anti-perovskites are structurally and energetically stable. Moreover, Rashba-type splitting in the electronic structure of Ca3SnO and Sr3SnO monolayers is observed owing to strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion asymmetry. On the other hand, monolayer Ba3SnO exhibits Dirac cone at the high-symmetry Γ point due to the domination of band overlap. Based on the predicted electronic transport properties, it is shown that inversion asymmetry plays an essential character such that the monolayers Ca3SnO and Sr3SnO outperform thermoelectric performance of their bulk counterparts.","meta":{"doi":"802984"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":16,"text":"Anti-perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":17,"end":43,"text":"A3SnO (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":104,"end":115,"text":"Dirac cones","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":144,"end":159,"text":"band structures","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":203,"end":219,"text":"crystal symmetry","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":221,"end":240,"text":"spin-orbit coupling","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":246,"end":258,"text":"band overlap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":318,"end":339,"text":"electronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":347,"end":362,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":364,"end":366,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":393,"end":435,"text":"first-principles density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":437,"end":440,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":709,"end":714,"text":"A3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":668,"end":672,"text":"bulk","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":677,"end":686,"text":"monolayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":715,"end":731,"text":"anti-perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":755,"end":768,"text":"2D monolayers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":787,"end":792,"text":"A3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":793,"end":809,"text":"anti-perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":916,"end":922,"text":"Ca3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":927,"end":933,"text":"Sr3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":934,"end":944,"text":"monolayers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":863,"end":884,"text":"Rashba-type splitting","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":973,"end":992,"text":"spin-orbit coupling","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":997,"end":1016,"text":"inversion asymmetry","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1037,"end":1046,"text":"monolayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1047,"end":1053,"text":"Ba3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1063,"end":1073,"text":"Dirac cone","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1128,"end":1140,"text":"band overlap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1165,"end":1196,"text":"electronic transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1289,"end":1295,"text":"Ca3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1300,"end":1306,"text":"Sr3SnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1278,"end":1288,"text":"monolayers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1318,"end":1344,"text":"thermoelectric performance","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":127,"created_at":"2022-10-29T01:19:07.626355Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T01:19:16.575342Z","lead_time":439.702}

{"text":"Solid-state thermoelectric energy conversion devices attract broad research interests because of their great promises in waste heat recycling, space power generation, deep water power generation, and temperature control, but the search for essential thermoelectric materials with high performance still remains a great challenge. As an emerging low cost, solution-processed thermoelectric material, inorganic metal halide perovskites CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 under mechanical deformation is systematically investigated using the first-principle calculations and the Boltzmann transport theory. It is demonstrated that halogen mixing and mechanical deformation are efficient methods to tailor electronic structures and charge transport properties in CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 synergistically. Halogen mixing leads to band splitting and anisotropic charge transport due to symmetry-breaking-induced intrinsic strains. Such band splitting reconstructs the band edge and can decrease the charge carrier effective mass, leading to excellent charge transport properties. Mechanical deformation can further push the orbital energies apart from each other in a more controllable manner, surpassing the impact from intrinsic strains. Both anisotropic charge transport properties and ZT values are sensitive to the direction and magnitude of strain, showing a wide range of variation from 20% to 400% (with a ZT value of up to 1.85) compared with unstrained cases. The power generation efficiency of the thermoelectric device can reach as high as approximately 12% using mixed halide perovskites under tailored mechanical deformation when the heat-source is at 500 K and the cold side is maintained at 300 K, surpassing the performance of many existing bulk thermoelectric materials.","meta":{"doi":"802980"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":52,"text":"Solid-state thermoelectric energy conversion devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":515,"end":547,"text":"the first-principle calculations","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":552,"end":582,"text":"the Boltzmann transport theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":434,"end":448,"text":"CsPb(I1−xBrx)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":422,"end":433,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":399,"end":421,"text":"inorganic metal halide","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":739,"end":753,"text":"CsPb(I1−xBrx)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":682,"end":703,"text":"electronic structures","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":795,"end":799,"text":"band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":708,"end":735,"text":"charge transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":826,"end":842,"text":"charge transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":900,"end":904,"text":"band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1015,"end":1042,"text":"charge transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1209,"end":1248,"text":"anisotropic charge transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1253,"end":1262,"text":"ZT values","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1378,"end":1386,"text":"ZT value","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1553,"end":1564,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":123,"created_at":"2022-10-28T13:43:18.898201Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T13:43:18.898201Z","lead_time":1399.057}

{"text":"X-ray microscopy is an essential imaging method in many scientific fields, which can be extended to three-dimensional (3D) using tomography. Recently, metal halide perovskite (MHP) nanomaterials have become a promising candidate for X-ray scintillators, due to their high light yield, high spatial resolution, and easy fabrication. Tomography requires many projections and therefore scintillators with excellent stability. This is challenging for MHPs, which often suffer from fast degradation under X-ray irradiation and ambient conditions. Here, we demonstrate that MHP scintillators of CsPbBr3 nanowires (diameter: 60 nm, length: 5–9 µm) grown in anodized aluminum oxide (CsPbBr3 NW/AAO) have sufficient stability for X-ray micro-tomography. A tomogram was taken with a Cu X-ray source over 41 h (dose 4.2 Gyair). During this period the scintillator brightness fluctuated less than 5%, which enabled a successful reconstruction. A long-term study with 2 weeks of continuous X-ray exposure (37.5 Gyair) showed less than 14% fluctuations in brightness and no long-term degradation, despite variations in the ambient relative humidity from 7.4 %RH to 34.2 %RH. The resolution was stable at (180 ± 20) 1pmm−1, i.e., about 2.8 micron. This demonstrates that CsPbBr3 NW/AAO scintillators are promising candidates for high resolution X-ray imaging detectors.","meta":{"doi":"802977"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":16,"text":"X-ray microscopy","annotation":"APL"},{"start":164,"end":174,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":181,"end":194,"text":"nanomaterials","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":233,"end":252,"text":"X-ray scintillators","annotation":"APL"},{"start":272,"end":283,"text":"light yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":290,"end":308,"text":"spatial resolution","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":589,"end":596,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":597,"end":606,"text":"nanowires","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":675,"end":682,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":773,"end":775,"text":"Cu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1256,"end":1263,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1330,"end":1353,"text":"X-ray imaging detectors","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":120,"created_at":"2022-10-28T12:06:42.185743Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T12:06:42.185743Z","lead_time":3363.901}

{"text":"All-inorganic lead-free double perovskite offers a potential material platform for electronic or optoelectronic memory devices owing to its ionic migration-based electrical transport, high photosensitivity, low toxicity, and environmental stability. However, the commonly used polycrystalline perovskite films severely restrict device performance. Herein, we demonstrate a high-performance memristor based on single-crystal double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 with an ultralow switching electric field of 6.67 × 104 V m−1 and a high current on/off ratio of 107. Remarkably, the resistive switching of Cs2AgBiBr6 is found to be thickness-dependent, which evolves from volatile threshold to nonvolatile resistance switching with the crystal thickness from 100 to 800 nm. Elemental analysis reveals that the formation of conductive channels in Cs2AgBiBr6 is associated with the migration of Br vacancies with low activation energy. In addition, the formed conductive channels can be annihilated by light illumination with controlled wavelength and intensity, which leads to the realization of optoelectronic memories with separate electrical-writing and optical-erasing processes. Our findings provide deep insights into the ionic migration in single-crystal perovskite and pave the way for its future application in electronic and optoelectronic memory devices.","meta":{"doi":"802974"},"tokens":[[{"start":14,"end":18,"text":"lead","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":19,"end":23,"text":"free","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":31,"end":41,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":97,"end":126,"text":"optoelectronic memory devices","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":140,"end":182,"text":"ionic migration-based electrical transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":189,"end":205,"text":"photosensitivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":211,"end":219,"text":"toxicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":225,"end":248,"text":"environmental stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":293,"end":303,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":304,"end":309,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":277,"end":292,"text":"polycrystalline","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":409,"end":423,"text":"single-crystal","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":24,"end":30,"text":"double","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":424,"end":430,"text":"double","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":431,"end":441,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":442,"end":452,"text":"Cs2AgBiBr6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":594,"end":604,"text":"Cs2AgBiBr6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":390,"end":399,"text":"memristor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":526,"end":546,"text":"current on/off ratio","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":470,"end":494,"text":"switching electric field","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":834,"end":844,"text":"Cs2AgBiBr6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":881,"end":883,"text":"Br","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1083,"end":1106,"text":"optoelectronic memories","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1234,"end":1248,"text":"single-crystal","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1249,"end":1259,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1322,"end":1351,"text":"optoelectronic memory devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":117,"created_at":"2022-10-28T10:05:52.224931Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T10:05:52.224931Z","lead_time":4912.354}

All calculations were performed by utilizing the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) method within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) under the potentials PBE-GGA, PBEsol-GGA, and WC-GGA. The optimized results show that the two compounds PVO, and NVO crystallize in a cubic structure with (Pm-3m) space group (No. 221) and lattice constants of (a = 3.8100 –3.8900 Å). Partial and total spin magnetic moments confirm the ferromagnetic (FM) nature of these compounds, and the major part of their total magnetic moments (MCell ≈ 4.0 and ≈ 5.0 μB) is contributed by V3+ ions through the FM 3d-2p exchange interaction V3+↑–O2−↓–V4+↑ within the ground-state energies.

{"text":"The recent emergence of lead-halide perovskites as active layer materials for thin film semiconductor devices including solar cells, light emitting diodes, and memristors has motivated the development of several new drift-diffusion models that include the effects of both electronic and mobile ionic charge carriers. In this work we introduce Driftfusion, a versatile simulation tool built for modelling one-dimensional ordered semiconductor devices with mixed ionic-electronic conducting layers. Driftfusion enables users to model devices with multiple, distinct, material layers using up to four charge carrier species: electrons and holes plus up to two ionic species. The time-dependent carrier continuity equations are coupled to Poisson’s equation enabling transient optoelectronic device measurement protocols to be simulated. In addition to material and device-wide properties, users have direct access to adapt the physical models for carrier transport, generation and recombination. Furthermore, a discrete interlayer interface approach circumvents the requirement for boundary conditions at material interfaces and enables interface-specific properties to be introduced.","meta":{"doi":"802969"},"tokens":[[{"start":24,"end":35,"text":"lead-halide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":36,"end":47,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":51,"end":63,"text":"active layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":120,"end":131,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":133,"end":154,"text":"light emitting diodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":160,"end":170,"text":"memristors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":343,"end":354,"text":"Driftfusion","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":497,"end":508,"text":"Driftfusion","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":621,"end":631,"text":" electrons","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":636,"end":641,"text":"holes","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":112,"created_at":"2022-10-28T08:26:21.077926Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T08:26:21.077926Z","lead_time":192.115}

{"text":"Creatinine, as a significant biomarker for kidney, thyroid, and muscle dysfunction-related diseases, detection is of great important meaning. In this paper, an enzyme-nanozyme cascade sensing platform was developed for visual creatinine detection. Perovskite oxide BiFeO3 synthesized by a sol–gel method was applied as a nanozyme, showing excellent peroxidase-like activity. During detection, creatinine was oxidized in turn by three natural enzymes (creatinase, creatininase, and sarcosine oxidase) to produce H2O2, and H2O2 was then catalyzed by the BiFeO3 nanozyme, resulting in the change of achromatous 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into blue oxidized TMB (oxTMB). Based on this principle, visual quantification of creatinine was realized. Due to the high stability and catalytic efficiency of nanozyme, the cascade sensing platform can be used to detect creatinine in a broad range of 0.5–150 μM with a detection limit of 0.09 μM. Meanwhile, thanks to the specificity of the natural enzymes, the platform exhibited admirable selectivity for creatinine determination despite the existence of a variety of interfering substances, which were successfully adopted to measure the level of creatinine in human serums. The cascade sensing platform is expected to serve the determination of a large number of biomarkers by simply alternating the natural enzymes.","meta":{"doi":"802967"},"tokens":[[{"start":265,"end":271,"text":"BiFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":248,"end":258,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":289,"end":303,"text":"sol–gel method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":321,"end":329,"text":"nanozyme","annotation":"APL"},{"start":511,"end":515,"text":"H2O2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":521,"end":525,"text":"H2O2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":552,"end":558,"text":"BiFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":559,"end":567,"text":"nanozyme","annotation":"APL"},{"start":768,"end":777,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":782,"end":802,"text":"catalytic efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":806,"end":814,"text":"nanozyme","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":110,"created_at":"2022-10-28T08:19:14.642576Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T08:19:14.642576Z","lead_time":148.235}

In a previous study, we found that a new Sr2Ti0.95Al0.05O4−δ (STA05) layered perovskite also shows evidence of protonic conductivity. However, Sr–Ti-based layered perovskites are also potential oxide-ion conductors. Detailed transport numbers for both protons and oxide-ions in Sr–Ti-based layered perovskites remain unclear. To solve this problem, we here propose an improved approach based on electromotive force (emf) measurements to account for the contributions of thermal emf and polarization to the total conductivity. In the first step of this study, the conditions for investigating actual emfs were evaluated using measurements of yttria-stabilized zirconia as a typical oxide-ion conductor. The optimized emf technique was subsequently used to evaluate the transport numbers of STA05, which was found to exhibit no oxide-ion transport. Thus, STA05 is concluded to be a mixed proton and electron conductor.","meta":{"doi":"803161"},"tokens":[[{"start":9,"end":11,"text":"Sr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":12,"end":14,"text":"Ti","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":29,"end":39,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":51,"end":60,"text":"compounds","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":69,"end":90,"text":"protonic conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":133,"end":152,"text":"Sr2Ti0.95Al0.05O4−δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":154,"end":159,"text":"STA05","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":169,"end":179,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":203,"end":224,"text":"protonic conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":235,"end":237,"text":"Sr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":238,"end":240,"text":"Ti","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":255,"end":266,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":286,"end":306,"text":"oxide-ion conductors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":370,"end":372,"text":"Sr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":373,"end":375,"text":"Ti","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":390,"end":401,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":487,"end":506,"text":"electromotive force","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":508,"end":511,"text":"emf","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":604,"end":616,"text":"conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":733,"end":759,"text":"yttria-stabilized zirconia","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":773,"end":792,"text":"oxide-ion conductor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":881,"end":886,"text":"STA05","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":945,"end":950,"text":"STA05","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":998,"end":1007,"text":"conductor","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":274,"created_at":"2022-11-04T06:42:47.768636Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T06:42:47.768636Z","lead_time":208.991}

For values of applied pressures up to 30 GPa and at zero temperature absolute, there is no phase transition was observed. Our results show that both compounds were mechanically stable. Static finite strain technique is employed to obtain the elastic constants and their pressure dependence. By analyzing the ratio between the bulk and shear moduli, it was found that LaVO3 is ductile than CaVO3 compound in nature. The metallic character of the studied perovskites was distinguished via their calculated band structure. We have found that O 2p states and V 3d states play a major role in the optical transitions as initial and final states, respectively. Total density of states at Fermi level revealed that LaVO3 should be more conductor than CaVO3. The increase in the antibonding state between the oxygen atoms yield in stiffness decreases. This was deduced when carrying out overlap population analysis. The Mulliken charge transfer suggests that CaVO3 is more covalent (less ionic) than LaVO3.

Consequently, various CPL activities, including prompt CPL, UC-CPL, and energy transfer enhanced circularly polarized luminescence (ET-CPL), were realized. The chiral perovskite nanocrystals could reabsorb the chiral energy generated from UCNPs, showing energy transfer enhanced CPL activity with four times magnification of the circular polarization.

By introducing a soluble polyethylene oxide (PEO) layer during the inkjet printing process, the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite is well controlled. Perovskite films can be easily printed in large scale and patterned in high resolution. Moreover, this method can be extended to various kinds of perovskite materials, such as MAPbI3 (MA = methylammonium), MA3Sb2I9, and (BA)2PbBr4 (BA = benzylammonium). The printed perovskite films show high quality and excellent mechanical performance. The photodetectors based on the MAPbBr3 perovskite films show a responsivity up to ∼ 1,036 mA/W and maintain over 96.8% of the initial photocurrent after 15,000 consecutive bending cycles.

The multifunctional molecule 4-[(trifluoromethyl) sulphanyl]-aniline (4TA) with trifluoromethyl (−CF3) and aniline (−NH2) moieties is meticulously designed to modulate the perovskite. The −CF3 and −NH2 functional groups have strong interaction with perovskite to suppress surface defects to improve device stability, as well as obtain large crystal grains through delaying crystallization. Moreover, this −CF3 forms a hydrophobic barrier on the surface of the perovskite to prevent cell decomposition. Consequently, the performance of the perovskite solar cells is remarkably improved with the efficiency increased from 18.00% to 20.24%.

{"text":"The response speed of the reported Cs2AgBiBr6-based photodetectors exhibits a wide variation ranging from microseconds to nanoseconds, while the reason is still unclear. Apart from the conventional approaches such as reducing effective area, new regulating approaches for response speed improvement have rarely been reported. On the other hand, it is generally believed that ultraviolet (UV) light has negative impact on perovskite devices resulting in performance degradation. In this work, we demonstrated that the response speed of the photodetector with FTO/Cs2AgBiBr6/Au structure can be effectively regulated by utilizing UV light-soaking effect without reducing the device area. Particularly, the decay time is efficiently modulated from 30.1 µs to 340 ns. In addition, the −3 dB bandwidth of the device is extended from 5 to 20 kHz.

Specifically, results of the study predict the (CsMA)NaSbI6 organic–inorganic hybrid double perovskite to be a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications due to its high absorption coefficient (on the order of 106 cm−1), dielectric constant (approx. 4.43), and refractive index (2.83) as well as the high formation energy depicting its stability. These results can be utilized for synthesis of sustainable and non-toxic optoelectronic devices.","meta":{"doi":"803136"},"tokens":[[{"start":41,"end":84,"text":"organic–inorganic hybrid double perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":118,"end":147,"text":"Pb-free non-toxic perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":172,"end":197,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":259,"end":269,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":271,"end":281,"text":"electronic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":286,"end":304,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":331,"end":379,"text":"(CsMA)NaSbX6(MA = methylammonium; X = Cl, Br, I)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":404,"end":446,"text":"first-principles density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":448,"end":451,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":469,"end":472,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":532,"end":540,"text":"bandgaps","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":632,"end":638,"text":"iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":655,"end":667,"text":"(CsMA)NaSbI6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":683,"end":708,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":725,"end":732,"text":"bromide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":738,"end":746,"text":"chloride","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":764,"end":777,"text":"(CsMA)NaSbBr6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":782,"end":795,"text":"(CsMA)NaSbCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":844,"end":856,"text":"(CsMA)NaSbI6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":857,"end":899,"text":"organic–inorganic hybrid double perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":976,"end":998,"text":"absorption coefficient","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1027,"end":1046,"text":"dielectric constant","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1067,"end":1083,"text":"refractive index","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1226,"end":1248,"text":"optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":249,"created_at":"2022-11-04T03:29:13.118641Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T03:29:13.118641Z","lead_time":202.781}

{"text":"Developing high-performance & cheaper solar cells is one of the fundamental aims of the researchers to achieve an economical levelised price of energy. Through studies, it can be easily visualized that efficiency of silicon based solar cells have been constrained to 27% for many years. On the other side, III-V solar cells are gradually exhibiting performance advancement with an increment of almost 1% per year, with current recorded PCE of nearly 45%. Assimilation of these III-V solar cells on comparatively economical Silicon layer has stimulated massive curiosity towards forthcoming energy plans by coalescing the advantages of III-V constituents with inexpensive & largely available Silicon. This paper will elaborate recent evolvement of III-V cell deposition over Silicon layer. Further, fundamental design principles & the technical contentions w.r.t coalition of III-V solar cells on Silicon layer are also elaborated. Various methods for coalescing III-V solar cells over Si layer through heteroepitaxial coalition & by mechanical stacking technique are discussed. With reduction in cost of silicon solar cells, complemented with huge space existing for enhancing the III-V solar cell PCE, the forthcoming visions for efficacious coalition of III-V solar cell over Silicon layer seems highly favorable to begin an epoch of forthcoming generation of high PCE & cost effective solar cells. Additionally, Perovskite Solar Cells are the optimistic contender for next generation solar cell with high efficiency, low cost and easy to manufacture techniques.

{"text":"Antireflection coatings (ARCs) have become one of the key techniques for mass production of Si solar cells. They are generally performed by vacuum processes such as thermal evaporation, sol–gel and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition. In this work, RF sputtering method was adopted to prepare the ARCs for the non-textured polycrystalline Si solar cells. The RF sputter coated strontium titanate(SrTiO3), barium titatnate(BaTiO3)and SrTiO3-BaTiO3(mechanical blends). Si solar cells were inspected through various characterisation techniques. Through RF sputter deposition technique, thin films with good uniformity can be achieved easily. The influence of ARC on solar cell samples were studied through evaluation of structural, optical and electrical properties of coated and uncoated samples. The structural characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).The electrical resistivity was measured in dark at room temperature using four-point probe technique. UV–visible spectroscopy was utilised for determining optical characterization. It was found that SrTiO3-BaTiO3blend coated cell (M3)has considerable effect on the performance of solar cell as compare to uncoated and other coated solar cells. The maximum power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 19.58% and 21.15% were achieved for M3 solar cell in presence of solar and neodymium irradiation under open and controlled atmospheric conditions. Neodymium light radiation was similar to the natural sun light and can be used for growing plants and veterinaries under enclosed surface. Based on the results, SrTiO3-BaTiO3 blends found to be an appropriate ARC material for minimising scattering of incident photons.","meta":{"doi":"803132"},"tokens":[[{"start":165,"end":184,"text":"thermal evaporation","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":186,"end":193,"text":"sol–gel","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":198,"end":239,"text":"plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":255,"end":275,"text":"RF sputtering method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":0,"end":23,"text":"Antireflection coatings","annotation":"APL"},{"start":25,"end":29,"text":"ARCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":303,"end":307,"text":"ARCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":345,"end":347,"text":"Si","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":348,"end":359,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":383,"end":401,"text":"strontium titanate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":402,"end":408,"text":"SrTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":411,"end":427,"text":"barium titatnate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":428,"end":434,"text":"BaTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":439,"end":452,"text":"SrTiO3-BaTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":453,"end":470,"text":"mechanical blends","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":473,"end":487,"text":"Si solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":92,"end":106,"text":"Si solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":556,"end":587,"text":"RF sputter deposition technique","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":589,"end":599,"text":"thin films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":662,"end":665,"text":"ARC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":669,"end":679,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":723,"end":733,"text":"structural","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":735,"end":742,"text":"optical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":747,"end":768,"text":"electrical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":852,"end":869,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":871,"end":874,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":880,"end":908,"text":"scanning electron microscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":910,"end":913,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":989,"end":1015,"text":"four-point probe technique","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1017,"end":1040,"text":"UV–visible spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1114,"end":1127,"text":"SrTiO3-BaTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1195,"end":1205,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1246,"end":1257,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1271,"end":1300,"text":"power conversion efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1302,"end":1305,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1349,"end":1359,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1385,"end":1394,"text":"neodymium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1457,"end":1466,"text":"Neodymium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1618,"end":1631,"text":"SrTiO3-BaTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1632,"end":1638,"text":"blends","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1127,"end":1132,"text":"blend","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1666,"end":1669,"text":"ARC","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":245,"created_at":"2022-11-04T02:46:37.040618Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T02:46:37.040618Z","lead_time":531.878}

{"text":"Cesium (Cs) doped methylammonium lead iodide thin films (MA1-xCsxPbI3, x = 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1) were formed using the spin-coated method in a dry air atmosphere.

The influence of doped Cs amount and adding CB during the preparation of the films on the transmittance, reflectance, absorption coefficient, skin depth, real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant, and photoluminescence emission of the films were explored. The films' refractive indices showed normal and abnormal dispersion in different parts of the spectra. The optical bandgap of the films depends on the amount of Cs doping. The optical bandgap of the films prepared without CB is less than that of the corresponding films formed with CB.

{"text":"The judicious implantation of active metal cations into the surface of semiconductor nanocrystal (NC) through cation-exchange is one of the facile and viable strategies to enhance the activity of catalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, by shortening the transfer pathway of photogenerated carriers and increasing the active sites simultaneously. However, cation-exchange is hard to achieve for halide perovskite NCs owing to the stable octahedron of [PbX6]4- with strong interaction between halogen and lead. Herein, we report a facile method to overcome this obstacle by replacing partial Br− with acetate (Ac−) to generate CsPbBr3 NC (coded as CsPbBr3−xAcx). A small amount of Ac− instead of Br− does not change the crystal structure of halide perovskite. Owing to the weaker interaction between acetate and lead in comparison with bromide, the corresponding octahedron structure containing acetate in CsPbBr3−xAcx can be easily opened to realize efficient cation-exchange with Ni2+ ions. The resulting high loading amount of Ni2+ as active site endows CsPbBr3−xAcx with an improved performance for photocatalytic CO2 reduction under visible light irradiation, exhibiting a significantly increased CO yield of 44.09 μmol·g−1·h−1, which is over 8 and 3 times higher than those of traditional pristine CsPbBr3 and nickel doped CsPbBr3 NC, respectively. This work provides a critical solution for the efficient metal doping of low-cost halide perovskite NCs to enhance their photocatalytic activity, promoting their practical applications in the field of photocatalysis.","meta":{"doi":"803126"},"tokens":[[{"start":85,"end":96,"text":"nanocrystal","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":98,"end":100,"text":"NC","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":196,"end":205,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":210,"end":238,"text":"photocatalytic CO2 reduction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":398,"end":415,"text":"halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":416,"end":419,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":454,"end":462,"text":"[PbX6]4-","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":440,"end":450,"text":"octahedron","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":495,"end":502,"text":"halogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":507,"end":511,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":594,"end":597,"text":"Br−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":603,"end":610,"text":"acetate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":612,"end":615,"text":"Ac−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":629,"end":636,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":637,"end":639,"text":"NC","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":650,"end":662,"text":"CsPbBr3−xAcx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":683,"end":686,"text":"Ac−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":698,"end":701,"text":"Br−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":743,"end":760,"text":"halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":802,"end":809,"text":"acetate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":814,"end":818,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":838,"end":845,"text":"bromide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":865,"end":875,"text":"octahedron","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":897,"end":904,"text":"acetate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":908,"end":920,"text":"CsPbBr3−xAcx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":984,"end":988,"text":"Ni2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1032,"end":1036,"text":"Ni2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1059,"end":1071,"text":"CsPbBr3−xAcx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1105,"end":1133,"text":"photocatalytic CO2 reduction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1204,"end":1206,"text":"CO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1306,"end":1313,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1318,"end":1324,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1325,"end":1330,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1331,"end":1338,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1339,"end":1341,"text":"NC","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1439,"end":1456,"text":"halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1457,"end":1460,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1558,"end":1572,"text":"photocatalysis","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":239,"created_at":"2022-11-04T02:07:42.354360Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T02:07:42.354360Z","lead_time":315.111}

The XRD spectra resulting from the synthesized samples revealed the formation of single-phase perovskite structure. The largest BET specific surface area related to the La2NiMnO6 perovskite synthesized by the gel-combustion method was obtained as 35 m2g−1 after calcination at 500 °C. Based on the findings, the catalysts synthesized by the gel-combustion method showed an increase in specific surface area, oxygen capacity, reducibility and oxygen mobility compared to those synthesized by the sol-gel method. Accordingly, these catalysts revealed a better performance. The acquired results also showed that the presence of Ni improved the catalytic activity compared to Co. The La2NiMnO6 perovskite synthesized by the gel-combustion method with the T90 equal to 415 °C was found to be the most active catalyst, while the La2CoMnO6 double perovskite synthesized by the sol-gel method with the T90 equal to 474 °C demonstrated the lowest activity.","meta":{"doi":"803121"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":19,"text":"La2MMnO6 (M=Co, Ni)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":25,"end":35,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":63,"end":70,"text":"sol-gel","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":75,"end":89,"text":"gel-combustion","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":161,"end":170,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":193,"end":196,"text":"TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":198,"end":201,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":203,"end":206,"text":"ICP","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":208,"end":211,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":213,"end":216,"text":"TEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":218,"end":224,"text":"H2-TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":229,"end":235,"text":"O2-TPD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":303,"end":329,"text":"physicochemical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":346,"end":349,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":436,"end":446,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":470,"end":490,"text":"BET specific surface","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":511,"end":520,"text":"La2NiMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":521,"end":531,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":551,"end":572,"text":"gel-combustion method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":654,"end":663,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":683,"end":704,"text":"gel-combustion method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":727,"end":748,"text":"specific surface area","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":750,"end":765,"text":"oxygen capacity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":767,"end":779,"text":"reducibility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":784,"end":799,"text":"oxygen mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":837,"end":851,"text":"sol-gel method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":872,"end":881,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":967,"end":969,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1014,"end":1016,"text":"Co","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1022,"end":1031,"text":"La2NiMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1032,"end":1042,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1062,"end":1083,"text":"gel-combustion method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1145,"end":1153,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1165,"end":1174,"text":"La2CoMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1175,"end":1192,"text":"double perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1212,"end":1226,"text":"sol-gel method","annotation":"SMT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":234,"created_at":"2022-11-04T01:37:13.940993Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T01:37:13.940993Z","lead_time":268.838}

{"text":"In the sintering of Ti-containing iron ores, the formation of perovskite was reported to harmfully affect the formation of silico-ferrite of calcium and aluminum. The formation of perovskite in ore blend of hematite and ilmenite ores in an Ar atmosphere was investigated in the temperature range of 1373 to 1523 K employing high-temperature in situ X-ray diffraction. The temperatures of melt formation in the ore blends were estimated employing thermal analysis in terms of thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry. The hematite ore was thermally decomposed to magnetite at high temperatures accompanied by the release of oxygen combined with iron. Addition of ilmenite ore to hematite ore increased the temperature of melt formation in the sintering of the ore blend. Ilmenite, FeO·TiO2(s), in the ore was oxidized to a metastable phase of Fe2O3·2TiO2(s) and was acerbated by oxygen released from thermal decomposition of hematite at about 1423 K.

{"text":"MAPbBr3 (MA = CH3NH3+) doping with bismuth increases electric conductivity, charge carrier density and photostability, reduces toxicity, and expands light absorption. However, Bi doping shortens excited-state lifetimes due to formation of DY− charge recombination centers. Using nonadiabatic molecular dynamics and time-domain density functional theory, we demonstrate that the DY− center forms a deep, highly localized hole trap, which accelerates nonradiative relaxation ten-fold and is responsible for 90% of carrier losses. Hole trapping occurs by coupling between the valence band and the trap state, facilitated by the Br atoms surrounding the Bi dopant. Passivation of the DY− center with chlorines heals the local geometry distortion, eliminates the trap state, and makes the carrier lifetimes longer than even in pristine MAPbBr3. The decreased charge recombination arises from reduced nonadiabatic coupling and shortened coherence time, due to diminished electron-hole overlap around the passivated defect. Our study demonstrates accelerated nonradiative recombination in Bi-doped MAPbBr3, suggests a strategy for defect passivation and reduction of nonradiative energy losses, and provides atomistic insights into unusual defect properties of metal halide perovskites needed for rational design of high-performance perovskite solar cells and optoelectronic devices.","meta":{"doi":"803118"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":7,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":9,"end":11,"text":"MA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":14,"end":21,"text":"CH3NH3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":23,"end":29,"text":"doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":35,"end":42,"text":"bismuth","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":53,"end":74,"text":"electric conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":76,"end":98,"text":"charge carrier density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":103,"end":117,"text":"photostability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":176,"end":178,"text":"Bi","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":179,"end":185,"text":"doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":195,"end":218,"text":"excited-state lifetimes","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":149,"end":165,"text":"light absorption","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":127,"end":136,"text":"toxicity,","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":279,"end":310,"text":"nonadiabatic molecular dynamics","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":315,"end":352,"text":"time-domain density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":420,"end":429,"text":"hole trap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":512,"end":526,"text":"carrier losses","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":528,"end":541,"text":"Hole trapping","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":573,"end":585,"text":"valence band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":625,"end":627,"text":"Br","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":650,"end":652,"text":"Bi","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":653,"end":659,"text":"dopant","annotation":"APL"},{"start":696,"end":705,"text":"chlorines","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":594,"end":604,"text":"trap state","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":758,"end":768,"text":"trap state","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":831,"end":838,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1082,"end":1084,"text":"Bi","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1085,"end":1090,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1091,"end":1098,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1254,"end":1278,"text":"metal halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1326,"end":1348,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1353,"end":1375,"text":"optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":231,"created_at":"2022-11-04T01:17:13.068023Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T01:17:13.068023Z","lead_time":425.652}

{"text":"Solution-processed perovskite wires are attractive candidates for photodetectors (PDs) due to their simple processibility as well as one-dimensional (1D) geometry with desirable charge carrier transport. However, the performance of the perovskite PDs is generally restricted by the charge carrier transport and extraction efficiency. Herein, we demonstrate that the charge transport and the consequent photodetection performance of MAPbI3 perovskite wires can be effectively enhanced by incorporating nanocrystals (NCs) of GaAs—a semiconductor with high charge carrier mobility. Taking advantage of the pulsed laser irradiation technique, we successfully fabricate ligand-free GaAs NCs with a size of ∽7 nm and homogeneously embed them in MAPbI3 perovskite wires through a simple solution-processed synthesis route. Compared with the pristine perovskite wires, the GaAs NCs modulated perovskite wires show improved charge carrier transport with the mobility rising from 1.13 to 3.67 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the resultant PD shows significant improvement in responsivity and detectivity. This study provides a new strategy for improving optoelectronic properties of halide perovskite materials and optimizing the device performance.","meta":{"doi":"803113"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":18,"text":"Solution-processed","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":19,"end":35,"text":"perovskite wires","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":66,"end":80,"text":"photodetectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":82,"end":85,"text":"PDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":133,"end":148,"text":"one-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":150,"end":152,"text":"1D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":178,"end":202,"text":"charge carrier transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":236,"end":247,"text":"perovskite ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":247,"end":250,"text":"PDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":282,"end":306,"text":"charge carrier transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":311,"end":332,"text":"extraction efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":366,"end":382,"text":"charge transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":402,"end":428,"text":"photodetection performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":432,"end":438,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":439,"end":455,"text":"perovskite wires","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":501,"end":513,"text":"nanocrystals","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":515,"end":518,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":523,"end":529,"text":"GaAs—a","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":554,"end":577,"text":"charge carrier mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":677,"end":681,"text":"GaAs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":682,"end":685,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":739,"end":745,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":746,"end":762,"text":"perovskite wires","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":780,"end":814,"text":"solution-processed synthesis route","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":843,"end":859,"text":"perovskite wires","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":865,"end":869,"text":"GaAs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":870,"end":873,"text":"NCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":884,"end":900,"text":"perovskite wires","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":915,"end":939,"text":"charge carrier transport","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1014,"end":1016,"text":"PD","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1050,"end":1062,"text":"responsivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1067,"end":1078,"text":"detectivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1129,"end":1154,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1165,"end":1175,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1158,"end":1164,"text":"halide","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":226,"created_at":"2022-11-03T14:50:34.144503Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T14:50:43.716582Z","lead_time":278.722}
{"text":"Tin (Sn) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most promising alternatives to lead (Pb) PSCs, which pose a theoretical limitation on efficiency and an environmental threat. However, Sn PSCs are still in the early stage of development in comparison with the conventional Pb PSCs, and still require a considerable amount of time and effort to obtain an optimum structure via manual trial-and-error methods. Herein, we propose a machine learning (ML) approach to accelerate the design of the optimized structure of Sn PSCs with high efficiency. The proposed method uses K-fold cross-validation-based deep neural networks, thus maximizing the prediction and recommendation accuracy with a limited amount of experimental data recorded for the Sn PSCs. Our approach establishes a new appropriate Sn-PSC design based on an ML recommendation algorithm.

{"text":"With the incorporation of noble metal materials, photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) could be performed as an effective platform for refractive index sensing of the filling analytes. Furthermore, by coating functional dielectric layers upon the metal surfaces, the resonance energy transfer is modulated from the core mode of the PCFs towards the surface plasmon resonance mode of the metals, and the sensing performance could be boosted. Here, considering that the exciton-plasmon coupling is efficient between perovskite quantum dots (QDs) and gold, a kind of CsPbBr3 QDs/Au bilayer coated triangular-lattice PCFs has been simulated numerically as the refractive index sensors. With the optimization of the QDs and gold layer thicknesses, together with the variation of the central hole size of the PCFs, in the refractive index (RI) region of 1.26 to 1.34, a rather narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the loss spectra was achieved as 13.74nm when the central hole size was 1.28 µm and the highest figure of merit was 63.79RIU (the central hole size was 1.53 µm). This work demonstrates that the analyte identification accuracy was enhanced by FWHM narrowing of the loss spectra; in addition, taking the abundance of the material choice of perovskite QDs into consideration, more analytes could be detected effectively. Moreover, by adopting asymmetric structures, the sensitivity of the PCFs based refractive index sensors could be further improved.","meta":{"doi":"803109"},"tokens":[[{"start":49,"end":72,"text":"photonic crystal fibers","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":74,"end":78,"text":"PCFs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":325,"end":329,"text":"PCFs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":461,"end":485,"text":"exciton-plasmon coupling","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":507,"end":517,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":518,"end":530,"text":"quantum dots","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":532,"end":535,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":541,"end":545,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":557,"end":564,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":565,"end":568,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":569,"end":571,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":572,"end":579,"text":"bilayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":587,"end":605,"text":"triangular-lattice","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":606,"end":610,"text":"PCFs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":649,"end":673,"text":"refractive index sensors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":704,"end":707,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":712,"end":716,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":796,"end":800,"text":"PCFs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":809,"end":825,"text":"refractive index","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":827,"end":829,"text":"RI","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":871,"end":897,"text":"full width at half maximum","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":899,"end":903,"text":"FWHM","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":912,"end":924,"text":"loss spectra","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1150,"end":1154,"text":"FWHM","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1172,"end":1184,"text":"loss spectra","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1246,"end":1256,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1257,"end":1260,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1394,"end":1398,"text":"PCFs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1405,"end":1429,"text":"refractive index sensors","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":222,"created_at":"2022-11-03T14:31:28.880111Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T14:31:38.166513Z","lead_time":349.767}

{"text":"Perovskite single crystals have received enormous attention in recent years. This is, perhaps, due to their simplistic synthesis and excellent optoelectronic properties including the long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, low trap density, and tuneable absorption edge ranging from ultra-violet to near-infrared. These distinguishing features offer numerous potential applications in energy-related fields like solar cells, photodetectors, lasers, etc. Efficiency enhancement and stability, in general, are the main challenges to obtaining better solar cells. One of the main reasons for the early degradation of solar cells is heat generation due to high energy electrons and holes in the conduction and valance bands. In this study, the authors try to introduce the concept of selective energy contacts in perovskite solar cells. Also, they investigate how this concept affects the power conversion efficiency (enhancement) and heat generation due to hot electrons and holes (reduction) scattering in the conduction and valance bands. Both efficiency enhancement and reduction in heat generation have been calculated in this study. Thus, for mathematical modeling of the anticipated idea, the Methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbI3) material is used in a PIN structure for a single-junction solar cell. Also, for the proposed structure, analytical modeling was introduced and it is shown that the efficiency of a single contact cell is around 25%, and after applying the second contact, the efficiency was increased to 35%. Finally, due to the reduction of heat loss in the structure, the stability of perovskite material is significantly increased.","meta":{"doi":"803107"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":10,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":143,"end":168,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":188,"end":212,"text":"carrier diffusion length","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":219,"end":235,"text":"carrier mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":241,"end":253,"text":"trap density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":426,"end":437,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":439,"end":453,"text":"photodetectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":455,"end":461,"text":"lasers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":495,"end":504,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":562,"end":573,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":628,"end":639,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":705,"end":715,"text":"conduction","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":720,"end":733,"text":"valance bands","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":823,"end":845,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":899,"end":926,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":972,"end":981,"text":"electrons","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":986,"end":991,"text":"holes","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1210,"end":1236,"text":"Methylammonium lead halide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1238,"end":1248,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1308,"end":1318,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1606,"end":1615,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1619,"end":1629,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":220,"created_at":"2022-11-03T13:50:12.075162Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T13:50:12.075162Z","lead_time":5585.635}

{"text":"Multifunctionalities of double perovskites depend strictly on the 3d/4d/5d-transition metals that can be purposefully tuned by doping effect at the transition metal-site. In the present study, the effects of Ni doping at the Co-site on the dielectric, magnetodielectric, complex impedance, complex modulus and ac-conductivity are investigated in detail for the La2Co1-xNixMnO6 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5) double perovskites. At room temperature, all the compounds exhibited monoclinic crystal symmetry (space group P21/n). No structural phase transition and/or impurity phases were observed after doping. The dielectric behavior is investigated over a wide frequency (100–1 MHz) and temperature (100–300 K) ranges, revealing an enhancement in the dielectric constant for the doped samples compared to parent La2CoMnO6. The magnetodielectric effect is also observed for x = 0 and x = 0.1 samples under 3 T magnetic field. The contributions of grain and grain boundaries at high and low frequencies become evident from the complex impedance spectroscopic and modulus studies. The corresponding carrier activation energies for all the samples are estimated from the Arrhenius fittings. The Nyquist plots are fitted well with an equivalent circuit consisting of two parallel resistance–capacitance elements connected in series, representing the grain and grain boundary effects.

{"text":"ABO3 perovskites, owning unique properties, have great research prospect in electromagnetic wave absorption field. Normally, doping can significantly regulate the dielectric loss, whereas the magnetic loss can be ignored. In this work, the crystal structure and electromagnetic properties can be regulated systematically by the K, Fe co-doping for LaCoO3 perovskites (LKCFO) under the condition of fixed F content. In addition, the obtained samples show the obvious interfacial polarization effect on accounting to the small size effect, which is conducive to the effective microwave absorption. By analyzing the evolution of the positron annihilation lifetime and the first-principles calculation of the oxygen density of states for the series of LKCFO perovskites, it is found that the charge transport characteristics will be controlled by the point defect generated by allelic doping. The point defect content decreases and then increases as the doping level rises. The prepared perovskite exhibits the lowest defect density and the largest dielectric loss capability, which indicates that the lower point defects promote electron migration and thus enhance the dielectric loss; thus, the electromagnetic wave absorption bandwidth up to 6.2 GHz is reached. In contrast, both insufficient and excessive K doping are detrimental to the enhancement of microwave absorption. Especially, the practical application value was investigated using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) simulations. The LKCFO-2 exhibits the smallest RCS value (below −10 dBm2) at almost −90°–90° with a thickness of 2 mm, providing an effective method for study excellent microwave absorption and scattering property.","meta":{"doi":"803103"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":16,"text":"ABO3 perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":76,"end":113,"text":"electromagnetic wave absorption field","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":163,"end":178,"text":"dielectric loss","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":192,"end":205,"text":"magnetic loss","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":328,"end":329,"text":"K","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":331,"end":333,"text":"Fe","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":334,"end":343,"text":"co-doping","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":348,"end":354,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":355,"end":366,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":368,"end":373,"text":"LKCFO","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":404,"end":405,"text":"F","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":466,"end":497,"text":"interfacial polarization effect","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":748,"end":753,"text":"LKCFO","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":669,"end":697,"text":"first-principles calculation","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":983,"end":993,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1014,"end":1028,"text":"defect density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1045,"end":1060,"text":"dielectric loss","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1126,"end":1144,"text":"electron migration","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1166,"end":1181,"text":"dielectric loss","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1306,"end":1307,"text":"K","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1308,"end":1314,"text":"doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1442,"end":1472,"text":"Computer Simulation Technology","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1474,"end":1477,"text":"CST","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1496,"end":1503,"text":"LKCFO-2","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":216,"created_at":"2022-11-03T08:52:20.012745Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T08:52:20.012745Z","lead_time":5944.056}

The excellent optical properties and easy preparation of organometal halide perovskite-based photovoltaic products enable their wide applications in electro-optical and opto-electrical conversions. In this review, photoinduced free carriers, exciton recombination, and diffusion properties of perovskite photoelectronic devices are discussed. By controlling grain sizes and grain boundaries, suppressing defects, and conducting interfacial charge transfer, their dynamics can be controlled in a versatile manner. The generality and differences in “effective carriers” for device applications, including their electro-optical and opto-electrical conversions, are discussed. In all-optical devices, a strong light-matter interaction causes nonlinear effects, such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, and optical blenching, which enable high-resolution imaging, optical modulation, and optical switching.

Several characterization techniques, such as XRD, UV-DRS, SEM, EDS, HRTEM and photoluminesence, were employed to study their structural and physicochemical properties. The photocatalytic performance of as-prepared samples was assessed by degrading Rhodamine B dye under UV irradiation. Results indicate that Ag/Cu deposition significantly enhanced the photocatalytic activity of CTO, depending upon the amount of metal loading.

In the present work, diphasic composites with core–shell nanostructures formed by La2Fe2O6/CoFe2O4 are investigated. The core–shell structure is fabricated via different preparation methods. The advantages and the demerits of the synthesis techniques are discussed. The presence of both the spinel CoFe2O4 nano ferrite and orthorhombic La2Fe2O6 perovskite phases is revealed by X-ray diffraction. XPS spectroscopy is utilized to investigate the chemical composition of the prepared samples. The hysteresis loops of the prepared samples exhibit a smooth loop that is resulted from the existence of two homogeneous magnetic phases. For the first time, it has been found that the preparation conditions have the advantage of reducing the switching field distribution value for the core–shell nanoparticles. Exchange coupled core–shell nanoparticles present a high potential to regulate the magnetic properties for numerous applications such as heavy metal removal and/or data storage devices. The maximum adsorption capacity (qm) of Cr III on the core–shell (S3) is higher compared to other adsorbents previously testified in the literature. The cost-effective and eco-friendly prepared core–shell samples with good metal removal capacity have great potential for commercialization.","meta":{"doi":"803096"},"tokens":[[{"start":118,"end":132,"text":"nanocomposites","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":168,"end":187,"text":"diphasic composites","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":193,"end":203,"text":"core–shell","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":204,"end":218,"text":"nanostructures","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":229,"end":237,"text":"La2Fe2O6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":238,"end":245,"text":"CoFe2O4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":268,"end":278,"text":"core–shell","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":445,"end":452,"text":"CoFe2O4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":453,"end":458,"text":"nano ","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":458,"end":465,"text":"ferrite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":470,"end":482,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":483,"end":491,"text":"La2Fe2O6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":492,"end":502,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":525,"end":542,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":544,"end":560,"text":"XPS spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":642,"end":658,"text":"hysteresis loops","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":925,"end":935,"text":"core–shell","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":968,"end":978,"text":"core–shell","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":979,"end":992,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1034,"end":1053,"text":"magnetic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1331,"end":1341,"text":"core–shell","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":209,"created_at":"2022-11-03T02:31:21.036666Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T02:31:21.036666Z","lead_time":447.073}
{"text":"This work reviews technologies that can be used to develop low-temperature solid oxide cells (LT-SOCs) and can be applied in fuel cells and electrolyzers operating at temperatures below 500°C, thus providing a more cost-effective alternative than conventional high-temperature SOCs. Two routes showing potential to reduce the operating temperature of SOCs to below 500°C are discussed. The first route is the principal way to enhance cell performance, namely, structure optimization. This technique includes the reduction of electrolyte thickness to the nanometer scale and the exploration of electrode structure with low polarization resistance. The other route is the development of novel proton-conducting electrolyte materials, which is in the frontier of SOCs study. The fundamentals of proton conduction and the design principles of commonly used electrolyte materials are briefly explained. The most widely studied electrolyte materials for LT-SOCs, namely, perovskite-type BaCeO3- and BaZrO3-based oxides, and the effect of doping on the physical—chemical properties of these oxide materials are summarized.","meta":{"doi":"803095"},"tokens":[[{"start":59,"end":92,"text":"low-temperature solid oxide cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":94,"end":101,"text":"LT-SOCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":125,"end":135,"text":"fuel cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":140,"end":153,"text":"electrolyzers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":277,"end":281,"text":"SOCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":351,"end":355,"text":"SOCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":622,"end":645,"text":"polarization resistance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":760,"end":764,"text":"SOCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":948,"end":955,"text":"LT-SOCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":965,"end":975,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":981,"end":987,"text":"BaCeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":993,"end":999,"text":"BaZrO3","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":208,"created_at":"2022-11-03T02:23:52.594890Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T02:23:52.594890Z","lead_time":1458.16}

{"text":"Amongst the different perovskites being investigated for application in solar cells, one of the most frequently scrutinized is methylammonium lead iodide CH3NH3PbI3 (or MAPbI3), which is usually obtained by the reaction of lead iodide (PbI2) with methylammonium iodide (MAI). Although this perovskite has been extensively studied and utilized in the manufacture of high-efficiency solar cells, its formation chemistry is still not well understood. Reliable experimental determination of the activation energy between PbI2 and MAI has been difficult due to the rapid reaction at room temperature. In this work, we determined the activation energy by adopting the Arrhenius equation. This was possible by controlling the reaction using MAI vapor, instead of liquid solution. This procedure allowed the reaction to be carried out at temperatures of up to 150 °C. The formation of MAPbI3 films was obtained by a two-step process: deposition of thin PbI2 film by thermal evaporation and subsequent conversion into perovskite by exposure to MAI vapor. The conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 as a function of temperature was probed by X-ray diffraction. An activation energy of 0.12 ± 0.02 eV was obtained. This low value explains the ease of MAPbI3 formation at low temperatures, and partially explains its instability in environmental conditions.","meta":{"doi":"803093"},"tokens":[[{"start":22,"end":33,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":72,"end":83,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":127,"end":153,"text":"methylammonium lead iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":154,"end":164,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":169,"end":175,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":223,"end":234,"text":"lead iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":236,"end":240,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":247,"end":268,"text":"methylammonium iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":270,"end":273,"text":"MAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":290,"end":300,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":381,"end":392,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":517,"end":521,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":526,"end":529,"text":"MAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":662,"end":680,"text":"Arrhenius equation","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":734,"end":737,"text":"MAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":877,"end":883,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":884,"end":889,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":945,"end":949,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":950,"end":954,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1009,"end":1019,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1035,"end":1038,"text":"MAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1064,"end":1068,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1072,"end":1078,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1122,"end":1139,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1144,"end":1161,"text":"activation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1230,"end":1236,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1295,"end":1306,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":206,"created_at":"2022-11-03T01:40:51.094058Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T01:40:51.094058Z","lead_time":976.625}

However, the film quality of AIHPs fabricated by typical spin-coating and subsequent high-temperature annealing is still not satisfactory, restricting their further development. Herein, we demonstrate a simple low-temperature solution-processed drop-casting method to achieve highly-crystalline cubic CsPbBr3 and lead-free layer-structured Cs3Sb2I9 microcrystals (MCs). This drop-casting technique not only consumes the less amount of precursor solution but also eliminates the high-temperature annealing as compared with those of spin coating. When these MCs are configured into photodetectors, they exhibit superior device performance, which is in distinct contrast to the one of spin-coated counterparts. Specifically, the responsivity of CsPbBr3 MCs is found to be as large as 8,990 mA/W, being 13 times larger than the spin-coated films and even better than many state-of-the-art solution-processed AIHPs devices. This device performance enhancement is attributed to the better film quality and phase purity obtained by the drop-casting method. All these results can evidently fill the “technology gap” for further enhancing the material quality of solution-processed AIHPs and breaking down the barriers that hinder the development of AIHPs based optoelectronic devices.","meta":{"doi":"803090"},"tokens":[[{"start":20,"end":44,"text":"photoelectric properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":53,"end":62,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":99,"end":131,"text":"all-inorganic halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":133,"end":138,"text":"AIHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":156,"end":177,"text":"lead-free perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":244,"end":249,"text":"AIHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":272,"end":284,"text":"spin-coating","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":289,"end":326,"text":"subsequent high-temperature annealing","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":425,"end":479,"text":"low-temperature solution-processed drop-casting method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":510,"end":515,"text":"cubic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":516,"end":523,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":555,"end":563,"text":"Cs3Sb2I9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":564,"end":577,"text":"microcrystals","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":579,"end":582,"text":"MCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":528,"end":537,"text":"lead-free","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":538,"end":554,"text":"layer-structured","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":771,"end":774,"text":"MCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":795,"end":809,"text":"photodetectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":897,"end":908,"text":"spin-coated","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":746,"end":758,"text":"spin coating","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":957,"end":964,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":965,"end":968,"text":"MCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1039,"end":1050,"text":"spin-coated","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1119,"end":1124,"text":"AIHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1244,"end":1263,"text":"drop-casting method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1388,"end":1393,"text":"AIHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1456,"end":1461,"text":"AIHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1468,"end":1490,"text":"optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":290,"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:15:19.179839Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:15:19.179839Z","lead_time":317.378}
{"text":"The race towards modern photovoltaic devices necessitates the development of more efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSC) at reliable cost. Metal oxides are exploited as better materials for electron and hole transport in PSCs. ZnO has emerged as a better substitute for the TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) owing to its higher electron mobility, low cost, simple synthesis methodologies and low annealing temperature which facilitates its application on flexible substrates. Most high-performance PSCs using ZnO ETL employ various organic hole transport layers (HTL) such as spiro-OMeTAD, which are high cost, unstable and involves complex fabrication processes. Metal oxide HTLs are commonly fabricated as p type HTL of ZnO-based inverted p-i-n structures of PSC. Cu2O has emerged as a p-type layer for various p-i-n configurations using ETLs such as TiO2 and phenyl c-61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The application of metal oxides such as Cu2O as the p type top HTL of PSC is considered as complex in fabrication. The work focusses on the fabrication of Cu2O and NiO as the top layer for ZnO n-i-p planar configuration, fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/Cu2O/Au and (FTO)/ZnO/CH3NH3PbI3/NiO/Au. Moreover, the metal oxides are synthesized by a simple solution synthesis process and used in their pure form without any doping or surface treatments. Different layers were grown using spin coating at room temperature.

{"text":"Photovoltaics based on lead halide perovskite (LHP) materials have attracted interest in recent years due to rapidly increasing performance conversion efficiency (PCE) and low material cost. However, current fabrication methods for perovskite solar cells (PSC) are mainly done under inert environments primarily due to the material’s sensitivity to moisture and oxygen. The development of practical upscaling technology for perovskite solar cells requires a fabrication technique that does not require inert conditions. In this report, we studied the significance of lead source and device architecture on the film quality of LHP when fabricated under ambient atmosphere (relative humidity, RH > 60%). Results suggest that LHP prepared from PbI2 salt has poor material morphology and optical properties regardless of the device architecture adopted. On the other hand, LHP prepared from both PbCl2 and PbAc2 showed superior morphology and optical quality when prepared on mesoporous TiO2 scaffold in comparison to a planar TiO2 layer. By utilizing an ambient-compatible and cost-efficient hole transport layer (HTL) copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN), we test the film quality by fabricating a full PSC using PbAc2 as the lead source under ambient conditions, with PCE reaching > 8.0%.","meta":{"doi":"803088"},"tokens":[[{"start":23,"end":45,"text":"lead halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":47,"end":50,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":128,"end":161,"text":"performance conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":163,"end":166,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":232,"end":254,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":256,"end":259,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":424,"end":446,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":626,"end":629,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":723,"end":726,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":741,"end":745,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":869,"end":872,"text":"LHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":892,"end":897,"text":"PbCl2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":902,"end":907,"text":"PbAc2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":983,"end":987,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1023,"end":1027,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1089,"end":1109,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1111,"end":1114,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1116,"end":1137,"text":"copper(I) thiocyanate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1139,"end":1144,"text":"CuSCN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1194,"end":1197,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1204,"end":1209,"text":"PbAc2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1260,"end":1263,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":288,"created_at":"2022-11-09T08:03:32.245832Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T08:03:32.245832Z","lead_time":168.824}

{"text":"A new design of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with non-peripherally substituted octahexylphthalocyanine (C6PcH2) hole transporting material (HTM) and MoOx buffer layer was introduced through experiment and simulation analysis. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) and current density–voltage (JV) characteristics were performed to analyze the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs based on C6PcH2 HTMs. The EQE was over 73% within the visible region (at 450 nm) but lower at 740 nm due to parasitic light absorption of C6PcH2 molecules. As a result, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) Jsc = 16.3 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) Voc = 0.95 V, fill factor (FF) FF = 35%, and a power conversion efficiency PCE = 5.4% were recorded under reverse bias scans (from open-circuit to short-circuit). Simulation analysis with Silvaco and SCAPS-1D was also performed to support the carrier transport analysis of PSCs with C6PcH2 HTM as well their photovoltaic performance in temperature range from 303 to 258 K, in which the charge carrier mobility of C6PcH2 molecules were strongly improved. By reducing the temperature from 303 to 258 K, the simulated PCE of 19.6% was achieved for the PSCs utilizing C6PcH2 as an HTM. The difference in PCEs between the synthesized and simulated devices was in part due to the alignment of C6PcH2 molecules in thin film.

Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of Pb–Sn and MAPbI3 solar cells remains around 9% and 10% after 71 and 51 days, respectively. Trap density and trap energy of around 1016 cm−3 and 0.45 eV were observed in Pb–Sn perovskite solar cells and around 1016 cm−3 and 0.13 eV for the MAPbI3 solar cell.

{"text":"Three perovskite solar cells with a general architecture of FTO/GO-CuI/Perovskite/ZnO/Ag electrode were fabricated with different ratios of graphene oxide and copper iodide as hybrid hole transport layers in an open-air environment for the comparison purposes and to find better hole transport material. The obtained power conversion efficiencies were extrapolated to find the power conversion efficiencies of other compositions of these materials including graphene oxide and copper iodide only-based devices. Hence, enhanced information was obtained by just making three devices only, which allowed us to save a lot of time and resources as compared to making devices in the standard conditions. The power conversion efficiency was increased with the decrease in concentration of graphene oxide, hence copper iodide showed better hole transport characteristics. This simplistic approach to evaluate power conversion efficiencies for hybrid charge transport layers can be utilized for any combination of hole or electron hybrid transport layers in perovskite solar cells.Graphical abstract","meta":{"doi":"119352"},"tokens":[[{"start":6,"end":16,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":17,"end":28,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":59,"end":66,"text":" FTO/GO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":67,"end":70,"text":"CuI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":82,"end":85,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":86,"end":88,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":140,"end":154,"text":"graphene oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":183,"end":198,"text":"hole transport ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":317,"end":346,"text":"power conversion efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":377,"end":406,"text":"power conversion efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":458,"end":472,"text":"graphene oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":477,"end":490,"text":"copper iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":71,"end":81,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":702,"end":729,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":782,"end":796,"text":"graphene oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":805,"end":817,"text":"opper iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":831,"end":862,"text":" hole transport characteristics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":901,"end":929,"text":"power conversion efficiencie","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":159,"end":173,"text":"copper iodide ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1049,"end":1059,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1060,"end":1070,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":4,"created_at":"2022-11-09T04:38:54.279543Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T04:38:54.279543Z","lead_time":413.701}
{"text":"Synthesized oxynitride perovskites materials exhibited very interesting properties, in particular ferroelectricity, which allow their uses in various applications and qualify them as very promising candidates for multifunctional materials. This study highlights the use of first-principle calculations based on density functional theory to carry out investigations of spontaneous polarizations into two groups of perovskite-type oxynitrides. The first group is A3+B4+(O2N)7− where A3+ = Y, Sc, La, Lu and B4+ = Si, Ge, Sn while the second one is A2+B5+(O2N)7− where A2+ = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba and B5+ = V, Nb, Ta. Therefore, we have computed the structural parameters, formation energy, tolerance factor, octahedral factor, bond ionicity, spontaneous polarization, and band gaps. As a result, we have deduced (1) that all studied oxynitride perovskites are distorted and can be synthesized, and are all insulators or semiconductors, some of which have narrow energy gaps. (2) Some perovskites exhibit high spontaneous polarization values that appear to be stimulated by the large displacements of B-cations away from their centrosymmetric positions, by the lower B-cation ionic radius, and the higher A-cation ionic radius of the tetragonal ABO2N perovskite structure. (3) Spontaneous polarization in oxynitride perovskites increases for higher electronegativity of B-cations and lower interatomic distance between the B-cation and the N-anion. It also noted that spontaneous polarization was more pronounced in the valence group A3+B4+(O2N)7− than that of A2+B5+(O2N)7−.","meta":{"doi":"119351"},"tokens":[[{"start":12,"end":34,"text":"oxynitride perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":461,"end":475,"text":"A3+B4+(O2N)7− ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":481,"end":500,"text":"A3+ = Y, Sc, La, Lu","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":505,"end":521,"text":"B4+ = Si, Ge, Sn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":546,"end":560,"text":"A2+B5+(O2N)7− ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":566,"end":586,"text":"A2+ = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":590,"end":606,"text":" B5+ = V, Nb, Ta","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1524,"end":1538,"text":"A3+B4+(O2N)7− ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1551,"end":1565,"text":"A2+B5+(O2N)7−.","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1235,"end":1240,"text":"ABO2N","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":98,"end":114,"text":"ferroelectricity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":213,"end":228,"text":"multifunctional","annotation":"APL"},{"start":273,"end":301,"text":"first-principle calculations","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":311,"end":336,"text":"density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":368,"end":393,"text":"spontaneous polarizations","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":412,"end":440,"text":" perovskite-type oxynitrides","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":640,"end":661,"text":"structural parameters","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":663,"end":679,"text":"formation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":681,"end":697,"text":"tolerance factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":699,"end":715,"text":"octahedral facto","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":718,"end":731,"text":"bond ionicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":733,"end":757,"text":"spontaneous polarization","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":762,"end":772,"text":" band gaps","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":543,"end":544,"text":"i","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":824,"end":846,"text":"oxynitride perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":897,"end":907,"text":"insulators","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":911,"end":926,"text":"semiconductors,","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":953,"end":964,"text":"energy gaps","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":975,"end":986,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1000,"end":1031,"text":"spontaneous polarization values","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1294,"end":1317,"text":" oxynitride perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1267,"end":1291,"text":"Spontaneous polarization","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1339,"end":1356,"text":"electronegativity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1458,"end":1482,"text":"spontaneous polarization","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":3,"created_at":"2022-11-09T04:31:51.160625Z","updated_at":"2022-11-09T04:31:51.160625Z","lead_time":687.436}
{"text":"Promising new materials like solution-processable perovskites may provide devices with superior properties, e.g. for opto-electronics. For some applications patterning is required and nanoimprint as a solvent-free, mechanical shaping process has been identified to be particularly favorable for this purpose. The current investigation refers to the organic–inorganic perovskite methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) and is related to direct imprint under pressure and temperature. Experiments with a single crystal and polycrystalline layers of differing grain size indicate that a large-grained starting layer offers optimum pre-conditions for the replication of micro/nano-structures. The aim of the present study is to develop a physical understanding of the shaping process with this polycrystalline material. To develop such a conception, analogies between the imprint of polycrystalline perovskites and the imprint of thermoplastic polymers are sought, and the consequences resulting from the differences in the microscopic material response are worked out. The main aspect with perovskites is that plastic deformation occurs due to gliding on crystallographic glide planes, similar to the case of metals. With a < 100 > -oriented perovskite layer the imprint pressure activates a (110) < 110 > -type glide system, providing material transport at 45° with respect to the surface normal. The consequences of this preferential direction are investigated by analyzing experiments with partial and complete filling of the cavities of the stamp used for imprint. By considering the geometric correlations during the initial imprint phase the experimental results can be understood. Beyond that, it turns out that under specific conditions the size and the shape of the grains can be controlled by the imprinted pattern. This ‘grain shaping by patterning’ provides unexpected, innovative prospects for the nanoimprint of perovskite layers.","meta":{"doi":"119350"},"tokens":[[{"start":29,"end":61,"text":"solution-processable perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":117,"end":133,"text":"opto-electronics","annotation":"APL"},{"start":349,"end":377,"text":"organic–inorganic perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":378,"end":416,"text":"methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":184,"end":196,"text":"nanoimprint ","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":441,"end":448,"text":"imprint","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":500,"end":514,"text":"single crystal","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":519,"end":541,"text":"polycrystalline layers","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":582,"end":611,"text":"large-grained starting layer ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":664,"end":685,"text":"micro/nano-structures","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":787,"end":812,"text":" polycrystalline material","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":865,"end":873,"text":" imprint","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":877,"end":905,"text":"polycrystalline perovskites ","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":912,"end":920,"text":" imprint","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":924,"end":946,"text":"thermoplastic polymers","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1018,"end":1047,"text":"microscopic material response","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1085,"end":1096,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1105,"end":1124,"text":"plastic deformation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1218,"end":1253,"text":" < 100 > -oriented perovskite layer","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1286,"end":1306,"text":" (110) < 110 > -type","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1583,"end":1606,"text":"geometric correlations ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1802,"end":1819,"text":"imprinted pattern","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1827,"end":1855,"text":"grain shaping by patterning’","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1906,"end":1918,"text":"nanoimprint ","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1921,"end":1938,"text":"perovskite layers","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":2,"created_at":"2022-11-04T10:51:26.929882Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T10:51:26.929882Z","lead_time":1660.568}

Among candidates, 5 mol% Zr-doped ZnTiO3 expressed much more significant improvement of photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (up to 19.6%) than non-doped ZnTiO3, ascribing to the change of the lattice structure, the existence of oxygen vacancies, and the decrease of electron–hole recombination rate.","meta":{"doi":"2"},"tokens":[[{"start":8,"end":14,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":15,"end":26,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":54,"end":56,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":58,"end":60,"text":"Zr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":61,"end":68,"text":"dopants","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":107,"end":141,"text":"ultrasonic-assisted sol–gel method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":179,"end":184,"text":"La–Zr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":185,"end":192,"text":"dopants","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":264,"end":269,"text":"Cubic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":270,"end":276,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":277,"end":288,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"APL"},{"start":348,"end":350,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":351,"end":356,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":369,"end":371,"text":"Zr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":372,"end":377,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":378,"end":384,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":393,"end":412,"text":" high crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":417,"end":438,"text":"rod-shaped morphology","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":458,"end":482,"text":"potential photocatalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":509,"end":511,"text":"Zr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":512,"end":517,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":518,"end":524,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":644,"end":650,"text":"ZnTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":634,"end":643,"text":"non-doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":602,"end":614,"text":"tetracycline","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":719,"end":725,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":757,"end":789,"text":"electron–hole recombination rate","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":2,"created_at":"2022-11-05T11:58:17.515632Z","updated_at":"2022-11-05T11:58:17.515632Z","lead_time":1400.561}

{"text":"Herein, we report a numerical simulation of a model perovskite solar cell whose architectural design is: glass/FTO/IGZO/CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The main goal was to optimize the performance of the device utilizing indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) as the electron transport layer. The performance of the device was explicitly compared with similar devices fabricated experimentally and theoretically. Although IGZO has attractive properties, it has not been widely utilized. The simulation was performed with the solar cell capacitance simulator software. In this model, the effects of varying several parameters on the overall solar cell performance were critically examined. These parameters include the thickness of the solar absorber (methylammonium lead iodide), hole transport and electron transport layers; doping densities of the hole transport and electron transport layers; density of defects of the absorber layer; back-contact metal work function and operational temperature. The simulation results showed that the performance of the device can be enhanced by optimizing the thickness of the absorber and its defect density, and also the thickness and doping densities of the hole transport and electron transport layers. It was found that an absorber interface with higher defect density resulted in poorer performance of the device. Additionally, it was noted that the cell operated best at low temperatures. Also, metallic back contacts, made of nickel, platinum or lead, gave similar results as gold. Therefore, these metals can be used as alternatives to gold since they are relatively cheaper. With the optimal conditions of the solar cell in place, the following photovoltaic characteristics were obtained: the power conversion efficiency PCE was 19.95%, short circuit current density (Jsc) was 25.55 mA cm-2, open circuit voltage (Voc) was 5.32 V and fill factor FF was 14.68%. This PCE value is higher than for comparable solar cells devices that have been examined either computationally or experimentally. These insights will prove useful in the fabrication and advancement of high-performance perovskite solar cells for large-scale applications.","meta":{"doi":"803070"},"tokens":[[{"start":52,"end":73,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":105,"end":110,"text":"glass","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":111,"end":114,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":115,"end":119,"text":"IGZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":120,"end":130,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":131,"end":143,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":144,"end":146,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":20,"end":40,"text":"numerical simulation","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":218,"end":243,"text":"indium gallium zinc oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":245,"end":249,"text":"IGZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":258,"end":282,"text":"electron transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":413,"end":417,"text":"IGZO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":516,"end":526,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":631,"end":641,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":742,"end":768,"text":"methylammonium lead iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":771,"end":785,"text":"hole transport","annotation":"APL"},{"start":790,"end":815,"text":"electron transport layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":817,"end":833,"text":"doping densities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":841,"end":855,"text":"hole transport","annotation":"APL"},{"start":860,"end":885,"text":"electron transport layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":887,"end":905,"text":"density of defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":948,"end":961,"text":"work function","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1124,"end":1138,"text":"defect density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1191,"end":1205,"text":"hole transport","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1210,"end":1235,"text":"electron transport layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1464,"end":1470,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1472,"end":1480,"text":"platinum","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1484,"end":1488,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1514,"end":1518,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1575,"end":1579,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1650,"end":1660,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1733,"end":1760,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1761,"end":1764,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1777,"end":1806,"text":"short circuit current density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1808,"end":1811,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1832,"end":1852,"text":"open circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1854,"end":1857,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1874,"end":1885,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1886,"end":1888,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1906,"end":1909,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1946,"end":1957,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":2120,"end":2142,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":279,"created_at":"2022-11-04T07:03:41.703781Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T07:03:41.703781Z","lead_time":319.876}
{"text":"The chemical looping epoxidation (CLE) of ethylene was performed over an Ag catalyst supported on strontium ferrite perovskite (SrFeO3-δ). CLE consists of a reduction step in ethylene where oxygen is transferred from the support to the Ag catalyst to form ethylene oxide (EO), and a separate regeneration step, in which the support is reoxidised in air. The effect of altering the reduction and oxidation times was investigated, analysing changes in the conversion of ethylene and selectivity to EO. Experiments were conducted at 270 °C in a packed bed of Ag(15 wt.%)/SrFeO3-δ with a gas hourly space velocity of 9600 h−1 and a total operation time > 40 h. When the time of the reduction step was increased from 1 to 3 min, selectivity to EO only decreased by 0.4%, demonstrating that CLE can run with prolonged reduction times while maintaining high selectivity. Increased duration of the reoxidation step resulted in both selectivity and conversion increasing, but when varying the oxidation time from 10 to 15 min, the overall improvement in the performance was minimal; thus, CLE can feasibly operate at shortened oxidation times. By increasing the pressure during the oxidation step to 2.5 bar, the duration of the reoxidation step was further shortened to 5 min without impacting the CLE performance. With 1.5 min reduction and 5 min reoxidation steps, a CLE installation producing EO in a pseudo-steady manner would require 4 packed bed reactors operating in parallel.

Both stability and charge lifetime can be restored by methylamine passivation with chlorines, which withdraw electrons from the lone electron pair of methylamine and bring the trap levels down into the valence band. The charge lifetime of the passivated system is even longer than that of the pristine perovskite.

The non-null magnetization and magnetic hysteresis loop at room temperature can indicate the formation of weak ferromagnetism in the paramagnetic (PM) region in both compounds. Moreover, our magnetic results show a complex magnetic response in these materials below TN, which can be attributed to the formation of various types of magnetic exchange interactions within the system such as antiferromagnetic (AFM), (ferromagnetic) FM, and ferrimagnetic (FiM) couplings.

{"text":"Interlayer excitons (IXs) formed in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)/two-dimensional (2D) perovskite heterostructures are emerging as new platforms in the research of excitons. Compared with IXs in TMD van der Waals heterostructures, IXs can be robustly formed in TMDs/2D perovskite heterostructures regardless of the twist angle and thermal annealing process. Efficient control of interlayer coupling is essential for realizing their functionalities and enhancing their performances. Nevertheless, the study on the control of interlayer coupling strength between TMD and 2D perovskites is elusive. Therefore, we realize the control of interlayer coupling between monolayer WSe2 and (iso-BA)2PbI4 with SiO2 pillars in situ. An abnormal 10-nm blue shift and 2.5 times photoluminescence intensity enhancement were observed for heterostructures on the pillar, which was contrary to the red shift observed in TMD heterobilayers. We attributed the abnormal blue shift to the enhanced interlayer coupling arising from the reduced gap between constituent layers. In addition, IXs became more dominant over intralayer excitons with enhanced coupling. The interlayer coupling could be further engineered by tuning the height (h) and diameter (d) of pillars. In particular, an additional triplet IX showed up for the pillar with an h/d ratio of 0.6 due to the symmetry breaking of monolayer WSe2. The symmetry breaking also induced an anisotropic response of IXs. Our study is beneficial for tuning and enhancing the performance of IX-based devices, exciton localization and quantum emitters.","meta":{"doi":"119350"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":26,"text":"Interlayer excitons (IXs) ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":76,"end":96,"text":"two-dimensional (2D)","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":97,"end":124,"text":"perovskite heterostructures","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":36,"end":75,"text":"transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":671,"end":680,"text":"monolayer","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":681,"end":685,"text":"WSe2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":691,"end":703,"text":"iso-BA)2PbI4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":709,"end":713,"text":"SiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":749,"end":759,"text":"blue shift","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":886,"end":899,"text":"the red shift","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":205,"end":208,"text":"TMD","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":209,"end":239,"text":"van der Waals heterostructures","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":271,"end":278,"text":"TMDs/2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":279,"end":306,"text":"perovskite heterostructures","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":571,"end":581,"text":"TMD and 2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":582,"end":593,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":912,"end":915,"text":"TMD","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":916,"end":930,"text":"heterobilayers","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":959,"end":969,"text":"blue shift","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1076,"end":1079,"text":"IXs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1388,"end":1392,"text":"WSe2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1456,"end":1459,"text":"IXs","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":2,"created_at":"2022-11-04T11:16:09.171096Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T11:16:09.171096Z","lead_time":2234.985}

Lead halide perovskites have recently emerged as one of the most promising materials for direct X-ray detection. However, the lead toxicity remains a worrisome concern for further commercial application. Great efforts have been made to search for lead-free perovskites with similar optoelectronic properties. Here, we present a lead-free oxide double perovskite material Ba2AgIO6 for X-ray detection. The lead-free, all-inorganic nature, as well as the high density of Ba2AgIO6, promises excellent prospects in X-ray applications. By employing the hydrothermal method, we successfully synthesized highly crystalline Ba2AgIO6 powder with pure phase. Furthermore, we prepared Ba2AgIO6 wafers through isostatic pressure and built X-ray detectors with Au/Ba2AgIO6 wafer/Au photo-conductive structure. The as-prepared X-ray detectors showed a sensitivity of 18.9 µC/(Gyair·cm2) at 5 V/mm, similar to commercial α-Se detectors showcasing their advantages for X-ray detection.","meta":{"doi":"803257"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"X-ray detection","annotation":"APL"},{"start":97,"end":120,"text":"Lead halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":186,"end":208,"text":"direct X-ray detection","annotation":"APL"},{"start":223,"end":227,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":344,"end":365,"text":"lead-free perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":379,"end":404,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":425,"end":458,"text":"lead-free oxide double perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":468,"end":476,"text":"Ba2AgIO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":481,"end":496,"text":"X-ray detection","annotation":"APL"},{"start":502,"end":506,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":566,"end":574,"text":"Ba2AgIO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":608,"end":626,"text":"X-ray applications","annotation":"APL"},{"start":645,"end":664,"text":"hydrothermal method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":713,"end":721,"text":"Ba2AgIO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":722,"end":728,"text":"powder","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":771,"end":779,"text":"Ba2AgIO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":780,"end":786,"text":"wafers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":824,"end":839,"text":"X-ray detectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":845,"end":847,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":848,"end":856,"text":"Ba2AgIO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":863,"end":865,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":857,"end":862,"text":"wafer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":910,"end":925,"text":"X-ray detectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1003,"end":1017,"text":"α-Se detectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1050,"end":1065,"text":"X-ray detection","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":364,"created_at":"2022-11-10T13:56:40.527191Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T13:56:40.527191Z","lead_time":181.012}
{"text":"With the target to fabricate more feasible catalysts for SRM to produce hydrogen, the interaction between Ni and LaBO3 (B = Al, Cr and Fe) perovskite supports with different B-sites has been explored. To avoid the formation of big Ni grains, the Ni loading is intentionally set as low as 2 wt%. XRD and Raman results revealed that the three LaBO3 supports are composed of pure perovskite phase, but have differed fine crystal structures. While LaFeO3 and LaCrO3 can be indexed to the orthorhombic perovskite phase, LaAlO3 can be indexed to the hexagonal phase. H2-TPR and XPS results have validated that NiO has varied interfacial interactions with the LaBO3 supports through partial electron transfer from the supports to Ni. As a consequence, the active metallic Ni surface areas are in the order of 2%Ni/LaAlO3 > 2%Ni/LaCrO3 > 2%Ni/LaFeO3, well consistent with the reaction performance. Furthermore, by varying the B-site element, the abundance of the active surface oxygen species (mainly O22−) is varied, obeying the sequence of 2%Ni/LaCrO3 > 2%Ni/LaAlO3 > 2%Ni/LaFeO3, well consistent with the anti-coking ability of the catalysts. It is discovered that the change of the fine crystal structure of LaBO3 supports can influence the SRM performance of the 2%Ni/LaBO3 catalysts evidently. The reaction performance of the catalysts is mainly determined by the active Ni surface area, but the anti-coking ability is majorly decided by the amount of active oxygen species.","meta":{"doi":"803256"},"tokens":[[{"start":43,"end":52,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":72,"end":80,"text":"hydrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":106,"end":108,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":113,"end":138,"text":"LaBO3 (B = Al, Cr and Fe)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":139,"end":149,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":231,"end":233,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":295,"end":298,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":303,"end":308,"text":"Raman","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":341,"end":346,"text":"LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":377,"end":387,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":444,"end":450,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":455,"end":461,"text":"LaCrO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":484,"end":507,"text":"orthorhombic perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":515,"end":521,"text":"LaAlO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":544,"end":553,"text":"hexagonal","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":561,"end":567,"text":"H2-TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":572,"end":575,"text":"XPS","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":604,"end":607,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":653,"end":658,"text":"LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":723,"end":725,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":765,"end":767,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":804,"end":806,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":807,"end":813,"text":"LaAlO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":818,"end":820,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":821,"end":827,"text":"LaCrO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":832,"end":834,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":835,"end":841,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":970,"end":976,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1036,"end":1038,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1039,"end":1045,"text":"LaCrO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1050,"end":1052,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1053,"end":1059,"text":"LaAlO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1064,"end":1066,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1067,"end":1073,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1127,"end":1136,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1204,"end":1209,"text":"LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1262,"end":1264,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1265,"end":1270,"text":"LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1271,"end":1280,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1324,"end":1333,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1369,"end":1371,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1457,"end":1463,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":363,"created_at":"2022-11-10T13:53:38.205195Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T13:53:38.205195Z","lead_time":207.418}
{"text":"The interface defects and nickel vacancies of the NiOx lead to interface charge recombination, which limits its application in perovskite solar cells. Here, graphdiyne oxide(GDYO) was added to NiOx as an inorganic hole transporting material. It is found that the average carrier lifetime declined from 29.2 ns to 5.4 ns and the recombination resistance increased significantly after the GDYO adding determined by the time-resolved photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. We further demonstrated that the GDYO adding to NiOx effectively improved the charge extraction, accelerated the charge transportation and suppressed the charge recombination. Consequently, the optimized NiOx(GDYO)-based cell showed superior performance with a higher fill factor(81.99%) and improved stability with respect to the reference device.

{"text":"In this study, the density functional theory has been used to perform the structural, electronic, magnetic and optical properties of the variant stable AgNiF3 (001) surfaces. The surface morphology is investigated under two truncations, namely AgNiF3/AgF (AgF) and AgNiF3/NiF (NiF). The enthalpy of formation, relaxation parameter and surface energy results show that the stable AgF and NiF surfaces can be fabricated. We have also performed the electronic properties which include band gap, DOS, electronic specific heat, charge contour plot and Fermi surface. The indirect (M–Γ) band gap value of the AgF surface has been found larger than NiF surface. The partial DOS and charge contour plots have shown the mixed type of bonding nature among the elements. The Fermi surface analysis of AgF surface has predicted a complex bonding between Ag-d and F-p hybridization, while in the case of NiF surface and bulk AgNiF3, Fermi surfaces are formed by contributions of Ag-d, Ni-d and F-p states.

{"text":"Defects located at the surfaces and grain boundaries of solution-processed perovskite films serve as nonradiative recombination centers and are detrimental for the photovoltaic performance of solar devices. Herein, a natural amino acid molecule methionine (Met) is selected as an effective passivation agent to enhance the optoelectronic properties of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films. The incorporation of a small amount of Met significantly reduces the trap-state density, contributing to longer carrier lifetime of the perovskite films. As a result, solar cells made of Met-mediated perovskite films deliver a high photovoltage of 1.145 V, which is up to 100 mV higher than the control device. In addition, the Met-mediated device exhibits enhanced stability due to the reduced trap states and the improved hydrophobic property of the modified perovskite film, which retains ~ 85% of their initial efficiency after 480-h storage.The effective methionine passivation is reported, which significantly reduces the trap-state density and leads to longer carrier lifetime of the perovskite films.

{"text":"Chalcogenide perovskites (CPs) exhibiting lower band gaps than oxide perovskites and higher stability than halide perovskites are promising materials for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. For such applications, the absence of deep defect levels serving as recombination centers (dubbed defect tolerance) is a highly desirable property. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we study the intrinsic defects in BaZrS3, a representative CP material. We compare Hubbard-U and hybrid functional methods, both of which have been widely used in addressing the band gap problem of semi-local functionals in DFT. We find that tuning the U value to obtain experimental bulk band gap and then using the obtained U value for defect calculations may result in over-localization of defect states. In the hybrid functional calculation, the band gap of BaZrS3 can be accurately obtained. We observe the formation of small S-atom clusters in both methods, which tend to self-passivate the defects from forming mid-gap levels. Even though in the hybrid functional calculations several relatively deep defects are observed, all of them exhibit too high formation energy to play a significant role if the materials are prepared under thermal equilibrium. BaZrS3 is thus expected to exhibit sufficient defect tolerance promising for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.","meta":{"doi":"803247"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":24,"text":"Chalcogenide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":26,"end":29,"text":"CPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":48,"end":57,"text":"band gaps","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":63,"end":80,"text":"oxide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":92,"end":101,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":107,"end":125,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":360,"end":385,"text":"density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":387,"end":390,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":440,"end":446,"text":"BaZrS3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":465,"end":467,"text":"CP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":489,"end":498,"text":"Hubbard-U","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":503,"end":528,"text":"hybrid functional methods","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":584,"end":592,"text":"band gap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":630,"end":633,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":695,"end":703,"text":"band gap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":821,"end":850,"text":"hybrid functional calculation","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":856,"end":864,"text":"band gap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":868,"end":874,"text":"BaZrS3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1059,"end":1089,"text":"hybrid functional calculations","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1165,"end":1181,"text":"formation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1266,"end":1272,"text":"BaZrS3","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":354,"created_at":"2022-11-10T13:19:39.458336Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T13:19:39.458336Z","lead_time":235.833}
{"text":"The aqueous phase reforming of glycerol, to hydrogen, alkanes and liquid phase dehydration/dehydrogenation products, was studied over a series of 1 wt% Pt/LaMO3 (where M = Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts and compared to a standard 1 wt% Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. The sol–gel combustion synthesis of lanthanum-based perovskites LaMO3 produced pure phase perovskites with surface areas of 8–18 m2g−1. Glycerol conversions were higher than the Pt/γ-Al2O3 (10%) for several perovskite supported catalysts, with the highest being for Pt/LaNiO3 (19%). Perovskite-based catalysts showed reduced alkane formation and significantly increased lactic acid formation compared to the standard catalyst. However, most of the perovskite materials undergo phase separation to LaCO3OH and respective M site oxides with Pt particle migration. The exception being the LaCrO3 support which was found to remain structurally stable. Catalytic performance remained stable over several cycles, for catalysts M = Al, Cr and Ni, despite phase separation of some of these materials. Materials where M site leaching into solution was observed (M = Mn and Co), were found to be catalytically unstable, which was hypothesised to be due to significant loss in support surface area and uncontrolled migration of Pt to the remaining support surface.

In general, it is prepared by a halogen solvent (chlorobenzene, CBZ) and needs an ion dopant (lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, Li-TFSI) to improve its conductivity and hole mobility. However, such a halogen solvent is not environmentally friendly and the widely used Li-TFSI dopant would affect the stability of PSCs. Herein, we develop a non-halogen solvent—tetrahydrofuran (THF)-prepared spiro-OMeTAD solution with a new p-type dopant, potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (K-FSI), to apply into PSCs. By this strategy, high-hole-mobility spiro-OMeTAD film is achieved. Meanwhile, the potassium ions introduced by diffusion into perovskite surface passivate the interfacial defects. Therefore, a hysteresis-free champion PSC with an efficiency of 21.02% is obtained, along with significantly improved stability against illumination and ambient conditions. This work provides a new strategy for HTMs toward hysteresis-free high-efficiency and stable PSCs by substituting dopants.","meta":{"doi":"803245"},"tokens":[[{"start":8,"end":77,"text":"2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":79,"end":91,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":118,"end":141,"text":"hole transport material","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":143,"end":146,"text":"HTM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":200,"end":205,"text":"n-i-p","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":223,"end":245,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":247,"end":251,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":303,"end":316,"text":"chlorobenzene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":318,"end":321,"text":"CBZ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":348,"end":391,"text":"lithium bis (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":393,"end":400,"text":"Li-TFSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":417,"end":429,"text":"conductivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":434,"end":447,"text":"hole mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":533,"end":540,"text":"Li-TFSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":541,"end":547,"text":"dopant","annotation":"APL"},{"start":565,"end":574,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":578,"end":582,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":625,"end":640,"text":"tetrahydrofuran","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":642,"end":645,"text":"THF","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":656,"end":668,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":689,"end":695,"text":"p-type","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":696,"end":702,"text":"dopant","annotation":"APL"},{"start":704,"end":738,"text":"potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":740,"end":745,"text":"K-FSI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":762,"end":766,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":791,"end":804,"text":"hole-mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":805,"end":817,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":818,"end":822,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":895,"end":905,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":987,"end":990,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":999,"end":1009,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1067,"end":1076,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1160,"end":1164,"text":"HTMs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1215,"end":1219,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1236,"end":1243,"text":"dopants","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":352,"created_at":"2022-11-10T13:11:34.844429Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T13:11:34.844429Z","lead_time":227.649}
{"text":"In this paper, A modified one-step method was used to prepare the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite film, and the planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PHPSCs) were assembled by optimizing the preparation process of the TiO2 compact layer (c-layer) and perovskite film. A TiO2 c-layer as the electron transfer layers (ETLs) was controlled by the spin coating method with the different TiO2 precursor solution and the number of spin coating. The perovskite layer, as a light absorption layer, was obtained by spin coating on the TiO2 c-layer with MAPbI3 precursor solutions of different mass concentrations. The characterization results show that although the preparation process is different, the surface morphology of TiO2 c-layer and perovskite layer are not very different, but there are some fluctuations in the thickness and internal structure of their films. The planar solar cell devices with c-TiO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Ag structure showed different photoelectric conversion performance. By optimizing the preparation process, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the assembled solar cell device can reach 12.11% based on a TiO2 c-layer obtained by two-spin coating with 0.1 M precursor solution and the perovskite layer obtained by spin coating with a mass concentration of 45% in MAPbI3 solution.","meta":{"doi":"803244"},"tokens":[[{"start":66,"end":76,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":78,"end":84,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":86,"end":96,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":97,"end":101,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":111,"end":118,"text":"planar ","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":118,"end":132,"text":"heterojunction","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":133,"end":155,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":157,"end":163,"text":"PHPSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":225,"end":229,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":258,"end":268,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":269,"end":273,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":277,"end":281,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":297,"end":321,"text":"electron transfer layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":323,"end":327,"text":"ETLs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":351,"end":370,"text":"spin coating method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":390,"end":394,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":432,"end":444,"text":"spin coating","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":450,"end":460,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":473,"end":495,"text":"light absorption layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":513,"end":525,"text":"spin coating","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":533,"end":537,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":551,"end":557,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":724,"end":728,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":741,"end":751,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":230,"end":243,"text":"compact layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":245,"end":252,"text":"c-layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":282,"end":289,"text":"c-layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":538,"end":545,"text":"c-layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":729,"end":736,"text":"c-layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":752,"end":757,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":874,"end":891,"text":"planar solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":905,"end":911,"text":"c-TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":912,"end":918,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":919,"end":922,"text":"HTM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":923,"end":925,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":953,"end":977,"text":"photoelectric conversion","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1034,"end":1069,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1087,"end":1097,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1133,"end":1137,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1138,"end":1145,"text":"c-layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1158,"end":1174,"text":"two-spin coating","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1213,"end":1223,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1224,"end":1229,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1242,"end":1254,"text":"spin coating","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1291,"end":1297,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":351,"created_at":"2022-11-10T13:07:45.939915Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T13:07:45.939915Z","lead_time":291.989}

An optoelectrical model is applied to achieve excellent light trapping by combining perovskite absorbing layers (PALs) with certain bandgap values, namely 1.6 eV, 1.7 eV, and 1.8 eV, for improved photogeneration. The optimized device structure exhibits an optimized short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.05 mA/cm2 and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.1 V, with an average fill factor (FF) of 86% and maximum PCE approaching 19%. Furthermore, the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE), with an average of 82%, was also achieved because of the improved optical characteristics of the PSC device, particularly in the visible spectrum range.

XRD and FTIR measurements show that the crystal structure and functional group of the (PEA)2PbI4 film don't change after introducing the polymer. The optical bandgap of the polymer-mixed (PEA)2PbI4 films gradually increased with increasing the concentrations of PVP and PEO polymers.

{"text":"The global demand for energy is steadily increasing in the past decades, leading to a rise of the uses of conventional energy sources which are causing serious environmental problems such as the greenhouse effect and pollution of the water and air supplies. Therefore, numerous alternatives to minimize the impact of environmental pollution have been tracking down and developed. In the quest for sustainable growth in all fields of human activity, the water and air purification by efficient catalysts which can be activated by natural sunlight is now a primary goal of the worldwide research activity. Employing laser-based methods such as laser pyrolysis (LP) or pulsed laser deposition (PLD) to obtain new or modified photocatalysts can contribute to these efforts, due to the fact that the native advantages of these techniques allow the use of several efficient strategies (sensitization, structural strain engineering, metal/non-metal doping) to enhance photocatalytic activity of different materials. In this chapter, the laser processing techniques advantages are presented through the functional property’s enhancement of different photoactive materials such as complex stoichiometry inorganic perovskites (BiFeO3-based materials) or binary oxides (TiO2, WO3, ZnO).

Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of 2D multilayered motifs with the A-site large-size cations occupying perovskite cavities. Here, by rational mixed-cation alloying, we present a new 2D hybrid perovskite, (4-TFBMA)2(DMA)Pb2I7 (1), in which the secondary cation of CH3NH2CH3+ (DMA) is located inside the perovskite cage while the aromatic 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzylammonium (4-TFBMA) cation acts as a spacer moiety. Benefiting from the quantum structure of alternating organic spacers and inorganic networks, crystal-array detectors of 1 show fascinating in-plane photodetection responses of large detectivity (−2.95 × 1012 Jones) and responsivity (−1.97 A W−1), comparable to those of some inorganic 2D counterparts. In addition, a fast response rate (−264 µs) and a low dark current are also realized, related to the high crystalline quality and suppression of the hopping barrier due to the insulating organic spacing layers.

{"text":"The need for high-efficiency radiation detectors with wide-area coverage is essential in applications such as nuclear medicine, industrial imagining, environmental radioactivity monitoring, spacecraft applications, and homeland security, among others. For these applications, the detector material should interact strongly with high-energy particles or photons, must be able to operate at high electric fields with negligible leakage current, must possess high resistivity, and must be scalable. Cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) possesses excellent electric, electronic, and spectroscopic properties while showing endurance to humidity and good stability under extreme operating conditions. These properties make it an ideal material for high-energy radiation detectors. The use of CsPbBr3 for heavily charged particle sensing is normally limited to single crystals due to the lack of deposition techniques for thick CsPbBr3 films, which is necessary for efficient radiation and neutron sensing. This chapter shows methods that allow the deposition of perovskite thin films with controlled thickness. The close-space sublimation (CSS) process allows for the deposition of stoichiometric and high-quality CsPbBr3 films with reduced defects and large grains with high deposition rates.

{"text":"In recent years, Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) is emerging as the most promising candidate to substitute the present Flash Technology in the nonvolatile memory market. RRAM is based on the Resistive Switching (RS) effect, where a change in the resistance of the material can be reversibly induced upon the application of an electric field. In this sense, Strongly correlated complex oxides present unique intrinsic properties and extreme sensitivity to external perturbations, which make them suitable for the nanoelectronics of the future. In particular, metallic complex oxides displaying metal-insulator transition (MIT) are very attractive materials for applications and are barely explored as RS active elements. In this work, we analyze the RS behavior of different films belonging to three different families of metallic perovskites: La0.8Sr0.2MnO3, YBa2Cu3O7–δ, and NdNiO3. We demonstrate that the application of an electric field induces a metal-insulator transition in these mixed ionic-electronic conductors. This volume RS is different in nature from interfacial or filamentary type and opens new possibilities of robust device design.

{"text":"Ionizing radiation, wherever present, e.g., in medicine, nuclear environment, or homeland security, due to its strong impact on biological matter, should be closely monitored. Availability of semiconductor materials with distinctive characteristics required for an efficient high-energy photon detection, especially with high atomic numbers (high Z), in sufficiently large, single-crystalline forms, which would also be both chemically and mechanically robust, is still very limited.In this chapter, we introduce the new metal halide perovskite material, which meets all aforementioned key requirements, at an extremely low cost. In particular, γ-ray detectors based on crystals of methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3) equipped with carbon electrodes were fabricated, allowing radiation detection by photocurrent measurements at room temperatures with record sensitivities (333.8 μC Gy−1 cm−2). Importantly, the devices operated at low bias voltages (<1.0 V), which may enable future low-power operation in energy-sparse environments, including space. The detector prototypes were exposed to radiation from a 60Co source at dose rates up to 2.3 Gy h−1 under ambient and operational conditions for over 100 h, without any sign of degradation. We postulate that the excellent radiation tolerance stems from the intrinsic structural plasticity of the organic-inorganic halide perovskites, which can be attributed to a defect-healing process by fast ion migration at the nanoscale level.Furthermore, since the sensitivity of the γ-ray detectors is proportional to the volume of the employed MAPbBr3 crystals, a unique crystal growth technique is introduced, baptized as the “oriented crystal-crystal intergrowth” or OC2G method, yielding crystal specimens with volume and mass of over 1000 cm3 and 3.8 kg, respectively. Large-volume specimens have a clear advantage for radiation detection; however, the demonstrated kilogram-scale crystallogenesis coupled with future cutting and slicing technologies may have additional benefits, for instance, enable the development for the first time of crystalline perovskite wafers, which may challenge the status quo of present and future performance limitations in all optoelectronic applications.","meta":{"doi":"803226"},"tokens":[[{"start":275,"end":303,"text":"high-energy photon detection","annotation":"APL"},{"start":521,"end":544,"text":"metal halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":645,"end":660,"text":"γ-ray detectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":682,"end":712,"text":"methylammonium lead tribromide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":714,"end":721,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":737,"end":744,"text":"carbon ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":744,"end":754,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":863,"end":876,"text":"sensitivities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":940,"end":953,"text":"bias voltages","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1060,"end":1068,"text":"detector","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1370,"end":1388,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1471,"end":1480,"text":"nanoscale","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1529,"end":1544,"text":"γ-ray detectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1591,"end":1598,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1675,"end":1711,"text":"oriented crystal-crystal intergrowth","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1716,"end":1727,"text":"OC2G method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":2103,"end":2113,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":2114,"end":2120,"text":"wafers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":2210,"end":2237,"text":"optoelectronic applications","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":333,"created_at":"2022-11-10T11:36:10.378035Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T11:36:10.378035Z","lead_time":269.161}

In particular, we have summarized the most interesting reports on perovskite oxides, a versatile oxide crystal structure which presents a plethora of functional properties depending on its exact composition and structural symmetry. We present the most relevant mechanisms inducing RS, such as valence change, due to a combination of oxygen vacancy drift and redox reactions; electronic correlations; and ferroelectricity. For each case, we explain the physicochemical processes triggered by the application of an external voltage (or current), which ultimately lead to a change in resistance at the interface between the metal electrode and the oxide. Special attention is paid to the material aspects of interface-type switching, and in particular to how the RS characteristics can be improved or triggered by cation doping and oxygen off-stoichiometry, by the introduction of additional layers and by changing the nature of the electrodes.

Fullerene materials have frequently been used in photovoltaic applications thanks to their excellent electrical properties, which include ultrafast photoinduced charge transfer and low reorganization energy. Accordingly, fullerene materials provide superior performance in both organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) despite playing different roles in these two types of cells. To date, fullerene organic photovoltaics have achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 21.3%, up from the PCE of 3.2% reported for the first fullerene derivative photovoltaics in 1995. In OSCs, fullerenes are used as electron acceptors and are mixed with an electron donor to fabricate the active layer of the device. Consequently, the energy level and molecular packing of fullerenes are major concerns and frequent subjects of investigation. In PSCs, on the other hand, a perovskite-structured compound is required in the active layer, so fullerenes are used as electron transport materials or dopants rather than as electron acceptors. For these roles in PSCs, attention shifted to electron carrier mobility, interlayer morphology, and passivation effects.

{"text":"Fluorinated and nitrogen-doped graphdiyne (F/N-GDY) have been used in the active layer of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time. The introduction of heteroatoms turns out to be an effective method for boosted solar cells performance, which increases by 32.8% and 33.0%, better than the pristine or GDY doped PSCs. The enhanced performance can be attributed firstly to the superiority of F/N-GDY originated from the unique structure and optoelectronic properties of GDY. Then, both can further reduce surface defects and improve surface and bulk crystallinity than pristine GDY. What’s more, efficiency increase caused by F-GDY is mainly attributed to the improvement of fill factor (FF), while the higher short-circuit current (JSC) plays more important role by N-GDY doping. Most importantly, the detailed mechanism brought about by doping of F-GDY or N-GDY is expounded by systematical characterizations, especially the synchrotron radiation technique. Doping of F-GDY causes PbII+x and forms new Pb-F bonds between F-GDY and Pb ions. Doping of N-GDY or GDY brings about PbII−x (N-GDY doping induces more deviation than that of GDY due to the participation of imine N), improving its electron density and conductivity.","meta":{"doi":"803220"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":41,"text":"Fluorinated and nitrogen-doped graphdiyne","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":43,"end":50,"text":"F/N-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":74,"end":86,"text":"active layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":90,"end":112,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":114,"end":118,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":220,"end":231,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":309,"end":312,"text":"GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":313,"end":318,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":319,"end":323,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":398,"end":405,"text":"F/N-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":447,"end":472,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":476,"end":479,"text":"GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":584,"end":587,"text":"GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":511,"end":526,"text":"surface defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":632,"end":637,"text":"F-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":681,"end":692,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":694,"end":696,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":716,"end":737,"text":"short-circuit current","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":739,"end":742,"text":"JSC","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":773,"end":778,"text":"N-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":855,"end":860,"text":"F-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":864,"end":869,"text":"N-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":976,"end":981,"text":"F-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1010,"end":1012,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1013,"end":1014,"text":"F","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1029,"end":1034,"text":"F-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1039,"end":1041,"text":"Pb","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1058,"end":1063,"text":"N-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1067,"end":1070,"text":"GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1092,"end":1097,"text":"N-GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1141,"end":1144,"text":"GDY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1173,"end":1180,"text":"imine N","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1197,"end":1213,"text":"electron density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1218,"end":1230,"text":"conductivity","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":327,"created_at":"2022-11-10T09:57:56.518351Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T09:57:56.518351Z","lead_time":217.527}
{"text":"The perovskite type materials with transition metals are getting more attention especially as catalysts in total oxidation reaction. This work explores the B metal effect on the catalytic activity of LaBO3 structured perovskites in total oxidation of toluene. The perovskite type oxides were obtained by Pechini method and characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry, temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and particle size analysis. The results showed that LaFeO3 catalyst contained a single orthorhombic LaFeO3 phase, while LaMnO3 contained LaMn2O5 species besides cubic LaMnO3 phase. Both catalysts show very narrow distributions and average values of 55.59 μm and 51.43 μm for LaMnO3 and LaFeO3, respectively. With regard to the H2-TPR profile for the LaMnO3, Mn4+ to Mn3+ reduction and Mn3+ to Mn2+ reduction. Consequently, the redox performance of ABO3 perovskites was found as mainly driven by the B-site transition-metal element character. According to the catalytic tests, the LaMnO3 catalyst was more active for toluene oxidation than LaFeO3 and achieved the lowest light-off temperatures. An excellent agreement between the experimental data and the proposed one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model was achieved and corresponding kinetic parameters (estimated rate constants, k, activation energies, EA, and frequency factors, Ar) were estimated. Lower activation energy was estimated for LaMnO3 catalyst (84 kJ mol−1 vs. 99 kJ mol−1 for LaFeO3) confirming that LaMnO3 catalyst was more active for toluene oxidation under reaction conditions presented in this paper.","meta":{"doi":"803219"},"tokens":[[{"start":4,"end":14,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":94,"end":103,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":107,"end":131,"text":"total oxidation reaction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":178,"end":196,"text":"catalytic activity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":200,"end":205,"text":"LaBO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":217,"end":228,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":232,"end":258,"text":"total oxidation of toluene","annotation":"APL"},{"start":264,"end":274,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":304,"end":318,"text":"Pechini method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":340,"end":357,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":359,"end":399,"text":"nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":401,"end":427,"text":"thermogravimetric analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":432,"end":465,"text":"differential scanning calorimetry","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":467,"end":499,"text":"temperature-programmed reduction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":501,"end":507,"text":"H2-TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":510,"end":528,"text":"Raman spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":530,"end":569,"text":"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":574,"end":596,"text":"particle size analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":622,"end":628,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":629,"end":637,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":657,"end":669,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":670,"end":676,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":690,"end":696,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":707,"end":714,"text":"LaMn2O5","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":731,"end":736,"text":"cubic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":737,"end":743,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":756,"end":765,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":845,"end":851,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":856,"end":862,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":897,"end":903,"text":"H2-TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":920,"end":926,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":928,"end":932,"text":"Mn4+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":936,"end":940,"text":"Mn3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":955,"end":959,"text":"Mn3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":963,"end":967,"text":"Mn2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1023,"end":1034,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1150,"end":1156,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1157,"end":1165,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1186,"end":1203,"text":"toluene oxidation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1209,"end":1215,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1334,"end":1349,"text":"one-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1436,"end":1450,"text":"rate constants","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1455,"end":1474,"text":"activation energies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1484,"end":1501,"text":"frequency factors","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1565,"end":1571,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1572,"end":1580,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1614,"end":1620,"text":"LaFeO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1638,"end":1644,"text":"LaMnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1645,"end":1653,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1674,"end":1691,"text":"toluene oxidation","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":326,"created_at":"2022-11-10T09:51:47.484984Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T09:51:47.484984Z","lead_time":690.705}
{"text":"It is shown, that conventional CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells, in the reported case with an initial efficiency of about 12%, show almost no degradation, when irradiated with 68 MeV protons for doses of up to 1012 protons cm−2. The 15% degradation, observed for a dose of 1013 protons cm−2, mainly due to a decrease of the short circuit current, is to a large amount only caused by the glass substrate coloring. Other solar cell parameters, like the fill factor and the open circuit voltage are not at all degrading even after this high radiation dose exposure. All solar cell parameters have also been monitored continuously in-situ during the exposure of the devices to proton irradiation and the results have been compared to conventional silicon photodiode degradation, confirming the much better stability under irradiation of the perovskite solar cells. Furthermore two other research activities, regarding perovskite related research at Salerno University are highlighted: By the characterization of perovskite solar cells with a new technique, based on the measurement of the temperature dependence of the low-frequency electrical noise spectra, the electronic defect structure and the solar cell efficiency could be clearly correlated.

{"text":"The present chapter is devoted to the synthesis, properties, and applications of graphitic carbon nitrides in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is an organic semiconducting polymeric material that is analogous in structure to the two-dimensional sp2-hybridized graphene sheets. It is a metal-free polymer with a tunable bandgap of 1.8–2.7 eV. This makes it possible to absorb light in the visible spectrum of 460–698 nm thus converting 13 to 49% of solar energy to useful electrical energy. In PSCs, g-C3N4 acts as a photocatalyst embedded in the light-absorbing layer of the solar cell. Hence, g-C3N4 helps in improving the efficiency of PSCs by assisting in the charge absorption and generation at the light-absorbing layer. Due to their high photoabsorption and photoresponsiveness, semiconducting properties, high stability under physiological conditions, and good biocompatibility, graphitic carbon nitrides have won tremendous attention among researchers recently. Incorporation of g-C3N4 in perovskite absorber layers improves its crystallinity and passivates defects leading to reduced charge carrier recombination which ultimately results in higher power conversion efficiency of PSCs.","meta":{"doi":"803217"},"tokens":[[{"start":81,"end":106,"text":"graphitic carbon nitrides","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":110,"end":132,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":134,"end":138,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":141,"end":165,"text":"Graphitic carbon nitride","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":167,"end":173,"text":"g-C3N4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":204,"end":213,"text":"polymeric","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":189,"end":203,"text":"semiconducting","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":261,"end":276,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":277,"end":291,"text":"sp2-hybridized","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":292,"end":307,"text":"graphene sheets","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":351,"end":358,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":525,"end":529,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":531,"end":537,"text":"g-C3N4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":548,"end":561,"text":"photocatalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":578,"end":599,"text":"light-absorbing layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":607,"end":617,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":626,"end":632,"text":"g-C3N4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":670,"end":674,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":735,"end":756,"text":"light-absorbing layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":776,"end":791,"text":"photoabsorption","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":796,"end":815,"text":"photoresponsiveness","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":817,"end":842,"text":"semiconducting properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":849,"end":858,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":900,"end":916,"text":"biocompatibility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":918,"end":943,"text":"graphitic carbon nitrides","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1019,"end":1025,"text":"g-C3N4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1029,"end":1039,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1040,"end":1055,"text":"absorber layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1069,"end":1082,"text":"crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1087,"end":1105,"text":"passivates defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1125,"end":1153,"text":"charge carrier recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1189,"end":1216,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1220,"end":1224,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":324,"created_at":"2022-11-10T08:57:19.543641Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T08:57:19.543641Z","lead_time":275.387}
{"text":"The high consumption rate of fossil fuels to meet the global energy demands attracts the progress of innovative energy storage and conversion systems. Among them, water electrolysis shows major concern because of its great potential to produce clean hydrogen energy. The dawdling dynamics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that occurs on the anode results in the low energy efficiency of the process. Perovskite oxide with transition metal on the B site possesses a high intrinsic as well as extrinsic activity toward OER. However, the low specific surface area restricts their catalytic activity. Here, we report on the synthesis of lanthanum cobaltite (LaCoO3) nanoparticles and bundles of nanorods using glycine and PVP surfactants, respectively, via the hydrothermal method. Structural characterizations confirmed the pure phase synthesis of LaCoO3 perovskite nanomaterials and further their electrocatalytic performance is investigated in an alkaline medium (1 M KOH). The results show that randomly oriented bundles of nanorods (average length 515 nm, average diameter 65 nm) exhibit smaller overpotential (η = 420 mV) at j = 10 mA cm−2 and the Tafel slope (99 mV dec−1) compared with nanoparticles (η = 450 mV and Tafel slope ~ 110 mV dec−1). The dramatically improved OER activity and larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of nanorods as compared to nanoparticles are because of the interconnected porous architecture of nanorods. Our work not only highlights the surfactant-assisted hydrothermal approach to synthesize the nanorods but also introduces the effect of a change in morphology on electrochemical activity.","meta":{"doi":"803216"},"tokens":[[{"start":163,"end":181,"text":"water electrolysis","annotation":"APL"},{"start":296,"end":321,"text":"oxygen evolution reaction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":323,"end":326,"text":"OER","annotation":"APL"},{"start":347,"end":352,"text":"anode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":406,"end":422,"text":"Perovskite oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":523,"end":526,"text":"OER","annotation":"APL"},{"start":583,"end":601,"text":"catalytic activity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":639,"end":658,"text":"lanthanum cobaltite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":660,"end":666,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":668,"end":681,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":686,"end":705,"text":"bundles of nanorods","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":712,"end":719,"text":"glycine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":724,"end":739,"text":"PVP surfactants","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":763,"end":782,"text":"hydrothermal method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":851,"end":857,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":858,"end":868,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":869,"end":882,"text":"nanomaterials","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":973,"end":976,"text":"KOH","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1019,"end":1038,"text":"bundles of nanorods","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1103,"end":1116,"text":"overpotential","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1156,"end":1167,"text":"Tafel slope","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1196,"end":1209,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1226,"end":1237,"text":"Tafel slope","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1281,"end":1284,"text":"OER","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1305,"end":1333,"text":"electrochemical surface area","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1335,"end":1339,"text":"ECSA","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1344,"end":1352,"text":"nanorods","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1368,"end":1381,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1439,"end":1447,"text":"nanorods","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1542,"end":1550,"text":"nanorods","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1482,"end":1523,"text":"surfactant-assisted hydrothermal approach","annotation":"SMT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":323,"created_at":"2022-11-10T08:52:42.255758Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T08:52:42.256757Z","lead_time":422.015}

{"text":"Mixed ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) ceramic membrane has rapidly become an attractive alternative technology to conventional pressure swing adsorption and cryogenic distillation for oxygen separation from air. Given the heat integration opportunity in most energy generation processes, this technology offers lower cost and energy penalty given its capability to produce pure oxygen at high temperature (>800 °C). The integration of dense MIEC membranes in oxyfuel combustion to supply an oxygen-rich feed stream in turn facilitates the production of concentrated carbon dioxide gas downstream, which can be easily captured and handled to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect. This chapter overviews and discusses all essential aspects to understand oxygen-selective MIEC ceramic membrane technology. The basics behind the formation of defects responsible for high-temperature ionic transport are explained together with the transport theory. Two major family structures, e.g., fluorite and perovskite, which become the building blocks of most MIEC materials are discussed. Specific structure and properties as well as the advantages and the drawbacks of each family are explained. Some important structural considerations, e.g., crystal structure packing and Goldschmidt tolerance factor, are elaborated due to their strong relationship with the properties. Two additional concepts, e.g., dual-phase membrane and external short circuit, are given to address the drawbacks associated with fluorite and perovskite MIEC materials. Various geometries and types of MIEC membranes can be prepared, e.g., disk, tube, hollow fiber with single or multiple channels, or flat plate, each of which fits particular application. MIEC membranes can be coupled with other applications to facilitate specific reactions to synthesize value-added products. Several oxygen permeation models and their applicability to different membranes are briefly highlighted.

It was found that by using a citric acid preparation method, perovskites with strong redox capabilities and weak Co–O bonds can be formed at relatively low calcination temperatures (550 °C) resulting in highly active catalysts.

{"text":"Solar energy conversion represents one of the better options to replace carbon-based technology. Among a wide variety of available technologies, well stablished silicon solar cells entails almost 90% of the up-scale installed technology. Nevertheless, from a decade ago perovskite solar cells interrupted abruptly in the research community as an impressive material that triggers the power energy conversion from 3.9 to 20% in just five years, being currently above 25.5% and very close to silicon efficiencies. Its easy and cost-effective fabrication process as well as its tuneable opto-electronic properties make perovskite material very suitable to solar energy conversion. Although it presents an amphiphilic character and long carrier transport, usually two selective layers (hole and electron) are deposited to assist charge extraction. Therefore, the proper selection of those selective contacts contributes not only to the improvement of the final performance of the solar cells, but also to the intrinsic stability of the device. In addition, the layered structure nature of the perovskite devices requires a good connection and a perfect energy level alignment between layers.

This chapter is focused on the utilization of electrochemically generated organic polymeric electrodes in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Electropolymerization is a very versatile procedure that can be used to construct organic films over metallic contacts or transparent conducting oxides. By selecting the correct polymerization group and the correct desired functionality, a significant number of monomers can be designed and synthesized to generate polymers. Some examples of devices based on electrogenerated organic polymers are solar cells, supercapacitors, and electrochromic devices. Solar cells convert sunlight into electric energy. Light absorption by the photoactive material produces electron–hole pairs, which are later separated, and they travel to the electronic contacts generating an electric work. Supercapacitors can store the energy generated by other energy sources with the ability to transform it into electric energy for its utilization when it is necessary. Electrochromic devices can modulate the light intensity and spectral distribution that go through them by modifications in their optical properties when their redox properties are changed.","meta":{"doi":"803201"},"tokens":[[{"start":191,"end":201,"text":"electrodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":205,"end":242,"text":"electronic and optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":244,"end":265,"text":"Electropolymerization","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":641,"end":652,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":654,"end":669,"text":"supercapacitors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":675,"end":697,"text":"electrochromic devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":699,"end":710,"text":"Solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":924,"end":939,"text":"Supercapacitors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1091,"end":1113,"text":"Electrochromic devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1220,"end":1238,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":309,"created_at":"2022-11-10T07:48:14.680387Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T07:48:20.769462Z","lead_time":190.919}

Finally, we presented some strategies of perovskite phosphor applications in WLEDs, such as by combining GaN chip with three-primary-color perovskite phosphors, through energy transfer in one perovskite, and by doping ions in perovskites.","meta":{"doi":"803193"},"tokens":[[{"start":165,"end":186,"text":"light-emitting diodes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":188,"end":193,"text":"WLEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":320,"end":325,"text":"WLEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":371,"end":375,"text":"LEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":491,"end":494,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":505,"end":508,"text":"LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":682,"end":705,"text":"Metal halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":706,"end":715,"text":"phosphors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":863,"end":873,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":874,"end":883,"text":"phosphors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1038,"end":1047,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1092,"end":1102,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1103,"end":1112,"text":"phosphors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1306,"end":1311,"text":"WLEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1334,"end":1337,"text":"GaN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1368,"end":1378,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1379,"end":1388,"text":"phosphors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1421,"end":1431,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":301,"created_at":"2022-11-10T02:53:40.335696Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T02:53:40.335696Z","lead_time":470.342}
{"text":"In this chapter, we premeditate on the architecture and material facet of plasmonic nanoparticles implanted within organic–inorganic halide Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), to yield higher solar absorbance enhancement. The selection of the material of nanoparticle employed within the film is proportional to the enhancement factor of the PSC. Study reveals that the copper nanoparticles produce at par absorbance to other conventional metals such as gold and silver. The utilization of copper could significantly lower this cost without conciliation the solar absorbance of the cell. The location and the size of the particle within the 200-nm-thick perovskite film are also analysed to get better solar absorbance of the designed solar cell. Study also highlights the impact of tailored plasmonic nanoparticles including nanospheres, nanocubes, nanocylinders, nanorods, nanotriangular plates, etc. rooted within the film. This architectural study is extended to the different inclination of a particle within the film, concerning the source of light. Different volumes of these copper nanoparticles are placed in the heart of the film to verify the enhancement of the light trapping efficiency of these designed cells. In the later section of the chapter, two nanoparticles in a unit cell as a dimer are taken into account. The anomalous effects on solar absorbance enhancement with the insertion of dielectric coated plasmonic copper nanoparticle within hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have also been observed. The metal-dielectric core-shell nanoparticles have been inserted into the active layers of thin-film organic solar cells to improve conversion efficiency.","meta":{"doi":"803192"},"tokens":[[{"start":74,"end":97,"text":"plasmonic nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":140,"end":162,"text":"Perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":164,"end":168,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":250,"end":262,"text":"nanoparticle","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":283,"end":287,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":337,"end":340,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":311,"end":329,"text":"enhancement factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":365,"end":371,"text":"copper","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":372,"end":385,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":449,"end":453,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":458,"end":464,"text":"silver","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":649,"end":659,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":660,"end":664,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":730,"end":740,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":787,"end":810,"text":"plasmonic nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":821,"end":832,"text":"nanospheres","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":834,"end":843,"text":"nanocubes","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":845,"end":858,"text":"nanocylinders","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":860,"end":868,"text":"nanorods","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":870,"end":891,"text":"nanotriangular plates","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1085,"end":1098,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1168,"end":1193,"text":"light trapping efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1260,"end":1273,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1428,"end":1434,"text":"copper","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1435,"end":1447,"text":"nanoparticle","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1455,"end":1486,"text":"hybrid organic–inorganic halide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1487,"end":1509,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1567,"end":1580,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1626,"end":1635,"text":"thin-film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1644,"end":1655,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1667,"end":1688,"text":"conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":300,"created_at":"2022-11-10T02:45:49.035377Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T02:45:49.035377Z","lead_time":759.986}

{"text":"Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites are materials that recently gained huge scientific attention for their superior characteristics. High optical absorption, ambipolar conductivity, high carrier mobility, bandgap tunability, and easy processing at low cost are properties that make this material unique. The hybrid nature of perovskite material containing both the properties of organic and inorganic ions makes it superior to other direct bandgap semiconductors in the field of photovoltaics. The chapter offers information on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials. It introduces other varieties of perovskites that are obtainable by incorporating different mixtures of cations and anions. The evolution of perovskite-based solar cells is explained in detail, including their fabrication process and working principles. Perovskite-based solar cell efficiency has rapidly progressed from 3.81% in 2009 to the current status where single-junction perovskite solar cell efficiency reached 25.2%. The chapter illustrates advanced perovskite solar cell structures like back contact cells and various tandem cells based on perovskites. It also discusses qualitatively different methods to fabricate large-area perovskite solar cells. Commercializing perovskite-based solar cells faces challenges such as their instability in ambient conditions and the toxicity of lead. Researches are in progress to tackle these drawbacks and those attempts are also presented.

Plasma processing compared to more traditional chemical treatment can be significantly cheaper and faster while eliminating the need for toxic organic solvents.

These need to be effectively removed for optimal properties of the resulting film. Plasma can provide reactive and energetic species to the surface of printed films for post-printing processing at significantly lower temperatures compared to conventional thermal annealing.

Specifically, the fluorescent intensity of CsPbBr3@CMO nanocomposite in water is decreased by 0.76% after 3 h; this result is comparable with those in earlier studies, and the good stability in water might be owned to the hydrophobic core of the CsPbBr3@CMO nanocomposite. The prepared CsPbBr3@CMO nanocomposite has been applied as a sensitive fluorescent probe for monitoring hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and the fluorescence intensity (~ 524 nm) has a linear relationship with the concentration of H2S in the range 0.15–105 µM with a detection limit of 53 nM, demonstrating application for monitoring H2S in rat brain coupled with microdialysis apparatus with satisfied results. The present study not only provides a simple but sensitive approach for the detection of H2S in living body, but also paves the way for expanding the application of CsPbBr3 QDs to aqueous medium.","meta":{"doi":"803164"},"tokens":[[{"start":32,"end":45,"text":"nanocomposite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":97,"end":104,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":113,"end":143,"text":"cetyltrimethylammonium bromide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":105,"end":108,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":187,"end":198,"text":"CsPbBr3@CMO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":199,"end":212,"text":"nanocomposite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":168,"end":178,"text":"sonication","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":148,"end":159,"text":"mineral oil","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":346,"end":357,"text":"CsPbBr3@CMO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":358,"end":371,"text":"nanocomposite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":429,"end":439,"text":"solubility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":444,"end":453,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":507,"end":518,"text":"CsPbBr3@CMO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":482,"end":503,"text":"fluorescent intensity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":519,"end":532,"text":"nanocomposite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":645,"end":654,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":710,"end":721,"text":"CsPbBr3@CMO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":722,"end":735,"text":"nanocomposite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":750,"end":761,"text":"CsPbBr3@CMO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":762,"end":775,"text":"nanocomposite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":873,"end":895,"text":"fluorescence intensity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":841,"end":857,"text":"hydrogen sulfide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":859,"end":862,"text":"H2S","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":959,"end":962,"text":"H2S","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1062,"end":1065,"text":"H2S","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1229,"end":1232,"text":"H2S","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1305,"end":1312,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1313,"end":1316,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":282,"created_at":"2022-11-05T06:50:57.809566Z","updated_at":"2022-11-05T06:50:57.809566Z","lead_time":222.116}

{"text":"In situ cross-linking encapsulation has been demonstrated to be an efficient strategy for enhancing the humidity stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, a novel cross-linkable fullerene derivative, namely 1-(p-benzoate-(p-methylvinylbenzene)-indolino[2,3][60] fullerene (FPPS), was readily synthesized from commercially available building blocks in two steps. This FPPS was employed as an interfacial modifier on perovskite surfaces in inverted planar p–i–n PSCs. Owing to the fast interfacial charge extraction and efficient trap passivation, PSCs based on the cross-linked FPPS (C-FPPS) exhibited excellent performance. The PSCs had a top-performing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.82% with negligible hysteresis, compared to the control devices without C-PFFS (16.99%). Moreover, the strong water resistance of the C-FPPS interfacial layer distinctly enhances the ambient stability of PSC devices, exhibiting a t80 (the time required to reach 80% of the initial PCE) of 300 h under high-humidity conditions. This significantly surpasses the control devices, whose t80 was only 130 h.

{"text":"Very recently, the newly emerging all inorganic perovskite have attracted a tremendous world-wide attention due to their unique optical properties. Particularly, CsPbBr3 is a very promising material for many optoelectronic devices. Hence, the understanding of the physics underlying these excellent photo-physical properties is highly required. Herein, we investigated the recombination mechanism in CsPbBr3 thin film using mainly the power-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (PLRT) measurements. The photoluminescence (PL) emission in CsPbBr3 perovskite was suggested to arise from the recombination of free carriers and localized trap states. We have found that the PL is decaying faster at a high excitation power density, from 11.2 to 2.1 ns for the excitation densities between 3.58 and 11.94  W/cm2. We used a dynamic recombination model to fit the unusual power-dependence transient PL results, from which numerous trap and recombination parameters can be extracted such as the trap density, which was evaluated, ranging from 3.1015 to 10.1015 cm-3 for the excitation densities between 3.58 and 11.94  W/cm2. Our analysis provides a clear identification of competing monomolecular-like and bimolecular-like recombination processes, These findings shed some light on the interesting luminescence mechanism of CsPbBr3 perovskite.","meta":{"doi":"803356"},"tokens":[[{"start":48,"end":58,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":128,"end":146,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":162,"end":169,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":208,"end":230,"text":"optoelectronic devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":299,"end":324,"text":"photo-physical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":400,"end":407,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":408,"end":417,"text":"thin film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":435,"end":502,"text":"power-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (PLRT) measurements","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":508,"end":539,"text":"photoluminescence (PL) emission","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":543,"end":550,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":551,"end":561,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":611,"end":624,"text":"free carriers","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":629,"end":650,"text":"localized trap states","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":675,"end":677,"text":"PL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":707,"end":731,"text":"excitation power density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":761,"end":781,"text":"excitation densities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":897,"end":899,"text":"PL","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":992,"end":1004,"text":"trap density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1322,"end":1329,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1330,"end":1340,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1296,"end":1318,"text":"luminescence mechanism","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":458,"created_at":"2022-11-15T02:26:13.044273Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T02:26:13.044273Z","lead_time":198.29}
{"text":"A correlation between depolarization temperature, ergodicity and piezoelectricity of niobium-substituted (Na0.41K0.09Bi0.50)TiO3 has been investigated. The dielectric measurements display significant lowering of depolarization temperature and critical transition temperatures with increasing niobium content. The reduction in these characteristic temperatures has been attributed to disruption of long-range interaction between the oxygen octahedra with substitution of aliovalent niobium (+ 5) ion at the titanium (+ 4) sites. For compositions with niobium content less than 0.5 mol%, a reasonable increase (20–25%) in the piezoelectric coefficients has been observed. These coefficients decrease significantly for more niobium content more than 1.0 mol%. The results have been explained on the basis of dominance of donor-like behaviour of niobium ion at lower doping concentrations and emergence of ergodic relaxor phase due to lowering of depolarization temperature, for higher doping concentration.

In this study, Cu-substituted PbNb2O6, with different concentrations, was prepared by a well-known solgel auto-combustion method. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of rhombohedral perovskite phase for PbNb2O6 which is transformed to monoclinic phase upon complete replacement of Pb by Cu. The surface morphology of all the samples suggested that, with the increase in copper content, the grain size decreased, which resulted in an increase in the density of these ceramics. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy assured the presence of all the elements in the samples in accordance with their empirical formulae. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed complete combustion, and the downward peaks in the corresponding spectra were purely related to perovskites. Frequency-dependent dielectric analysis showed that the dielectric constant and conductivity of PbNb2O6 improved with increasing Cu contents and less than 1% dielectric loss was achieved.

{"text":"In the last few years, two-dimensional (2D) metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are gaining tremendous attention and are replacing their three-dimensional (3D) congeners rapidly. These next-generation halide perovskites can circumvent the limitations of the 3D MHPs such as stability and structural diversity. The incorporation of bulky organic cation can not only prevent the moisture penetration into the crystal lattice and thus providing greater stability but also expands the field of hybrid semiconducting materials by offering structural diversity. These unique features render even higher tuneability and improved photophysical properties and as a result intensive investigations have been made for 2D MHP–based polycrystalline thin films. However, single crystals based on two-dimensional halide perovskites are still emerging and have great potential for future device applications. Along with the hybrid halide perovskites, the all inorganic halide perovskites are also blossoming. In this review, we have discussed exclusively the development of hybrid as well as all inorganic two-dimensional halide perovskites. First, we have discussed the crystal structure of 2D perovskites. In the next section, different growth procedures reported for preparation of single crystals are discussed. We then highlight the effect of doping on single crystals and their optoelectronic properties. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future perspectives to further develop 2D single crystals for their efficient use in various devices.","meta":{"doi":"803353"},"tokens":[[{"start":23,"end":38,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":40,"end":42,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":44,"end":68,"text":"metal halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":70,"end":74,"text":"MHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":133,"end":150,"text":"three-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":152,"end":154,"text":"3D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":197,"end":215,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":257,"end":261,"text":"MHPs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":254,"end":256,"text":"3D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":270,"end":279,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":284,"end":304,"text":"structural diversity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":403,"end":418,"text":"crystal lattice","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":446,"end":455,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":493,"end":507,"text":"semiconducting","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":530,"end":550,"text":"structural diversity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":618,"end":642,"text":"photophysical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":703,"end":705,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":706,"end":709,"text":"MHP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":716,"end":742,"text":"polycrystalline thin films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":778,"end":793,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":794,"end":812,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":949,"end":967,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":911,"end":929,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1086,"end":1101,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1102,"end":1120,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1172,"end":1174,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1175,"end":1186,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1364,"end":1389,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1477,"end":1479,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":455,"created_at":"2022-11-15T02:14:16.696045Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T02:14:16.696045Z","lead_time":230.945}

Compared with that of the catalysts synthesized by analytical reagents, the catalytic activities of SmMnO3-STLIB and SmCoO3-STLIB had been significantly enhanced. The analysis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the molar ratios of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Oads/Olatt of SmMnO3-STLIB were higher than that of pure SmMnO3 and the Co3+/Co2+ ratios of SmCoO3-STLIB was much larger than that of pure SmCoO3. The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and N2 adsorption-desorption tests determined that the reducibilities and specific surface areas of SmMnO3-STLIB and SmCoO3-STLIB were also superior to pure catalysts. Ultimately, the by-products of the catalytic oxidation of propylene glycol methyl ether over SmMnO3-STLIB were also detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

{"text":"Achieving efficient and stable hydrogen production has always been the focus of the industry, and ethanol steam reforming (ESR) is one of the most reliable, recyclable, and cheap technologies. Perovskite nanocomposite catalysts LaNixCo1−xO3−δ (x = 0, 0.5, 0.9) have been prepared by an EDTA-citric acid complexing sol–gel method and used for hydrogen production by ESR. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X‐ray diffraction (XRD), EDS and BET were used to characterize the crystal structure of the fresh and the reduced LaNi0.5Co0.5O3−δ. The optimal operating parameters of ESR experiments by Ni-doped LaNixCo1−xO3−δ perovskites were evaluated in detail. Results indicate that the optimum conditions for ESR are as below: reforming temperature is 600 °C; the molar ratio of H2O/C2H5OH is 5:1. In addition, the stable performance of LaNi0.5Co0.5O3−δ under the optimal operating condition was examined. Under the optimal reaction conditions, ethanol conversion of LaNi0.5Co0.5O3−δ perovskite as an ESR catalyst can reach the highest 90.2%.

{"text":"Despite demonstrating remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have not yet achieved their full potential. In particular, the interfaces between the perovskite and charge transport layers account for the vast majority of the recombination losses. Interfacial contact and band alignment between the low-temperature-processed TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and the perovskite are essential to minimize nonradiative recombination losses. In this study, a CeOx interlayer is employed to modify the perovskite/TiO2 interface, and the charge transport properties of the devices are investigated. The bilayer-structured TiO2/CeOx ETL leads to the modification of the interface energetics, resulting in improved electron extraction and reduced nonradiative recombination in the PSCs. Devices based on TiO2/CeOx ETL exhibit a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.13 V and an enhanced PCE of more than 20% as compared with Voc of 1.08 V and a PCE of approximately 18% for TiO2-based devices. Moreover, PSCs based on TiO2/CeOx ETL maintain over 88% of their initial PCEs after light illumination for 300 min, whereas PSCs based on TiO2 ETL almost failed. This study provides an efficient strategy to enhance the PCE and stability of PSCs based on a low-temperature-processed TiO2 ETL.","meta":{"doi":"803348"},"tokens":[[{"start":33,"end":62,"text":"power conversion efficiencies","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":64,"end":68,"text":"PCEs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":71,"end":93,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":95,"end":99,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":187,"end":197,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":202,"end":225,"text":"charge transport layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":362,"end":366,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":367,"end":391,"text":"electron transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":393,"end":396,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":406,"end":416,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":443,"end":476,"text":"nonradiative recombination losses","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":263,"end":283,"text":"recombination losses","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":495,"end":499,"text":"CeOx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":500,"end":510,"text":"interlayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":537,"end":547,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":548,"end":552,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":572,"end":599,"text":"charge transport properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":637,"end":644,"text":"bilayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":656,"end":660,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":661,"end":665,"text":"CeOx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":666,"end":669,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":747,"end":766,"text":"electron extraction","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":779,"end":805,"text":"nonradiative recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":813,"end":817,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":836,"end":840,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":841,"end":845,"text":"CeOx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":846,"end":849,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":865,"end":885,"text":"open-circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":887,"end":890,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":918,"end":921,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":956,"end":959,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":976,"end":979,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1005,"end":1009,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1035,"end":1039,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1049,"end":1053,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1054,"end":1058,"text":"CeOx","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1059,"end":1062,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1098,"end":1102,"text":"PCEs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1149,"end":1153,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1163,"end":1167,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1168,"end":1171,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1244,"end":1247,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1252,"end":1261,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1265,"end":1269,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1307,"end":1311,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1312,"end":1315,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":450,"created_at":"2022-11-14T11:05:51.799042Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T11:05:51.799042Z","lead_time":163.805}
{"text":"The poor stability of halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) has severely hindered future practical application. Herein, we proposed a facile and effective ligand modification route to synthesize stable CsPbBr3 nanocrystals by introducing a double-terminal ligand, namely 4,4′-Azobis(4-cyanovalericacid) (CA), to replace the conventional oleic acid (OA) ligand at room temperature. The as-synthesized CsPbBr3-CA not only possesses high photoluminescence quantum yield (72%) related to the reduced trap defects, but also shows significantly improved stability exposure to water, ethanol, light, and/or heat benefiting from the CA ligand anchored to NC surfaces tightly. The photoluminescence intensity of CsPbBr3-CA maintains about 80% and 75% of its initial emission intensity after immersed in water or ethanol for 360 min, respectively, whereas that of the CsPbBr3-OA was quenched completely within a few minutes. Moreover, an all-inorganic white light-emitting diode (LED) covered 126% National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard and 92% Rec.2020 standard was fabricated by combining the green CsPbBr3-CA and commercial red-emitting K2SiF6:Mn4+ (KSF) phosphors onto a blue LED chip.

{"text":"Perovskite materials have received extensive attention as optical gain media. However, it is tough to realize lasing using such materials on account of the unstable structure of MAPbI3/CsPbI3 nanocrystals (NCs), and the propensity for mixed-halogen perovskites to undergo phase decomposition into bromine-rich and iodide-rich regions under intense laser irradiation. To solve this issue, we fabricated CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) NCs, which were embedded into a glassy matrix with high stability. In addition, by doping Br− ions into the CsPbI3 NCs to partially replace I− ions, the optical efficiency and the optical gain properties were found to be significantly improved. Here, under 800 nm pulse laser excitation, red random lasing was realized with the assistance of such anion modulation.

{"text":"An ab initio study using density functional theory (DFT) is carried out to explore the structural, electronic, and optical properties of vanadium gallate (VGaO3) and niobium gallate (NbGaO3). The structural properties of these compounds are determined by using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) technique as implemented in WIEN2k with a standard functional, i.e., the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA). In addition, the local density approximation plus Hubbard parameter (LDA + U) is employed to calculate the electronic bandgap and total and partial density of states (TDOS and PDOS), to overcome the limitation of the PBE-GGA functional in terms of underestimation of the electronic bandgap. The values computed for the indirect bandgap of VGaO3 and NbGaO3 are 0.45 and 0.51 eV, respectively, indicating that both materials are semiconductors in nature. The PDOS of the studied materials reveal that 3d-states of vanadium atoms, 4d-states of niobium atoms, and 2p-states of oxygen atoms form the valence band.

Besides improving light confinement in the thin, perovskite active layer, the proposed structure improved the solar cell performance by enhancement of short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage through controlling radiative and non-radiative recombination. With these arrangements, an optimal power conversion efficiency limit of 40.01% has been calculated using the detailed-balance method, which indicates a 15.27% improvement compared to the original structure.

{"text":"Fill factor (FF) deficit and stability is a primary concern and challenge with the perovskite solar cell. The band alignment and resistance at the junction interface further decreases the fill factor and thus limits the performance of the device. Moreover, degradation of the intrinsic properties of the upcoming perovskite material such as methylammonium lead halide on exposure to ambience or moisture creates instability and decreases the shelf life of the device. To overcome all these challenges, we have engineered the device structure and introduces an earth-abundant material in the primitive perovskite structure by introducing an inorganic hole transport layer (HTL). It was observed from the calculation that the FF is sensitive to the band offset values. Moreover, the band alignment/band offset role and effect at the Perovskite/HTL junction were investigated. It is evident from the calculation that the inorganic material replacing Spiro-MeOTAD can enhance the stability of the device by providing insulation from ambient. The efficiency of SnS and spiro-MeOTAD were found to be comparable in the present work and thus the shelf life and moisture sensitivity challenge of the perovskite solar cell is addressed. Moreover, this work paves the way for earth-abundant p-type chalcogenides tin selenide (SnS) as a HTL layer in the perovskite solar cell.","meta":{"doi":"803335"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":11,"text":"Fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":13,"end":15,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":29,"end":38,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":83,"end":104,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":188,"end":199,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":313,"end":323,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":341,"end":367,"text":"methylammonium lead halide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":412,"end":423,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":601,"end":611,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":650,"end":670,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":672,"end":675,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":724,"end":726,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":831,"end":841,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":842,"end":845,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":947,"end":959,"text":"Spiro-MeOTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":976,"end":985,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1056,"end":1059,"text":"SnS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1064,"end":1076,"text":"spiro-MeOTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1191,"end":1212,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1280,"end":1286,"text":"p-type","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1315,"end":1318,"text":"SnS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1287,"end":1313,"text":"chalcogenides tin selenide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1325,"end":1328,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1342,"end":1363,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":437,"created_at":"2022-11-14T10:30:32.463465Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T10:30:32.463465Z","lead_time":193.882}

These CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx NWs were fabricated by the two-step deposition (TSD) processes. To fabricate different compositions of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx NWs, we varied the molar concentration of lead halide precursor (I/Br) keeping the total molar concentration fixed at 1 M. The microstructural, structural, and optical properties of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, respectively. We fabricate solar cells with the above CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx NWs absorber layer with simple device structure FTO/m-TiO2/NWs-Perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au.

{"text":"The quality and the stability of devices prepared from polycrystalline layers of organic–inorganic perovskites highly depend on the grain sizes prevailing. Tuning of the grain size is either done during layer preparation or in a post-processing step. Our investigation refers to thermal imprint as the post-processing step to induce grain growth in perovskite layers, offering the additional benefit of providing a flat surface for multi-layer devices. The material studied is MAPbBr3; we investigate grain growth at a pressure of 100 bar and temperatures of up to 150 °C, a temperature range where the pressurized stamp is beneficial to avoid thermal degradation. Grain coarsening develops in a self-similar way, featuring a log-normal grain size distribution; categories like ‘normal’ or ‘secondary’ growth are less applicable as the layers feature a preferential orientation already before imprint-induced grain growth. The experiments are simulated with a capillary-based growth law; the respective parameters are determined experimentally, with an activation energy of Q ≈ 0.3 eV. It turns out that with imprint as well the main parameter relevant to grain growth is temperature; to induce grain growth in MAPbBr3 within a reasonable processing time a temperature of 120 °C and beyond is advised. An analysis of the mechanical situation during imprint indicates a dominance of thermal stress. The minimization of elastic energy and surface energy together favours the development of grains with (100)-orientation in MaPbBr3 layers. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that the purity of the materials used for layer preparation is a major factor to achieve large grains; however, a diligent and always similar preparation of the layer is equally important as it defines the pureness of the resulting perovskite layer, intimately connected with its capability to grow. The results are not only of interest to assess the potential of a layer with respect to grain growth when specific temperatures and times are chosen; they also help to rate the long-term stability of a layer under temperature loading, e.g. during the operation of a device.","meta":{"doi":"803332"},"tokens":[[{"start":20,"end":29,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":55,"end":77,"text":"polycrystalline layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":99,"end":110,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":279,"end":294,"text":"thermal imprint","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":349,"end":359,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":360,"end":366,"text":"layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":477,"end":484,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":432,"end":443,"text":"multi-layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":960,"end":986,"text":"capillary-based growth law","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1053,"end":1070,"text":"activation energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1211,"end":1218,"text":"MAPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1521,"end":1528,"text":"MaPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1418,"end":1432,"text":"elastic energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1437,"end":1451,"text":"surface energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1500,"end":1517,"text":"(100)-orientation","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1529,"end":1535,"text":"layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1807,"end":1817,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1818,"end":1823,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":2062,"end":2071,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":434,"created_at":"2022-11-14T09:13:00.890774Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T09:13:00.890774Z","lead_time":286.9}

{"text":"The acidic, corrosive effect of sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) in poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) limits the stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag structure. In this work, a poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) hole transport layer (HTL) with high hole mobility and good catalytic performance was prepared by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method for inverted PSCs. By controlling the CV cycles (from 1 to 5 cycles) and EDOT monomer solution concentration (from 0.5 to 2.0 mmol·L−1) of electrochemical deposition, the thickness, morphology, optical and electrochemical properties of PEDOT could be accurately adjusted. The optimal photovoltaic performance with current density (Jsc) of 22.19 mA·cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.94 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.65 and photoelectric conversion efficiency of 13.56% was obtained when deposition of PEDOT with 1 CV cycle and EDOT concentration of 0.5 mmol·L−1. At this point, the perovskite showed good crystallization, optimal optical, charge transport and recombination performance, resulting in better Voc and photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the devices with higher CV cycle numbers and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) concentration. For comparison with spin-coated PEDOT:PSS, the device with electrodeposited PEDOT showed improved Jsc and comparable Voc, which may result from its better charge transport and catalytic ability. The device with spin-coated PEDOT:PSS showed photoelectric conversion efficiency of 12.25%, which was lower than that based on electrodeposited PEDOT (13.56%) with 1 CV cycles and 0.5 mmol·L−1 EDOT concentration. And the device with electrodeposited PEDOT as HTLs showed more excellent air stability. In ambient air ((32 ± 5) °C and RH: 70% ± 20%), it still maintained more than 80% of the initial photoelectric conversion efficiency after 1000 h. In comparison, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the device with PEDOT:PSS decreased to 20% of the initial value after storage for 500 h. From this study, a facial and low-cost way to prepare PEDOT HTL with high performances that better than the traditional PEDOT:PSS has been explored, which is expected to eliminate the acidic, corrosive effect of PSS in PEDOT:PSS.Graphic abstract","meta":{"doi":"803328"},"tokens":[[{"start":32,"end":60,"text":"sodium polystyrene sulfonate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":62,"end":65,"text":"PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":70,"end":130,"text":"poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:sodium polystyrene sulfonate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":132,"end":141,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":154,"end":163,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":176,"end":198,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":200,"end":204,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":219,"end":222,"text":"ITO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":223,"end":232,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":233,"end":243,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":244,"end":248,"text":"PCBM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":249,"end":252,"text":"BCP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":253,"end":255,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":283,"end":314,"text":"poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":316,"end":321,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":323,"end":343,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":345,"end":348,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":421,"end":467,"text":"electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":481,"end":485,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":541,"end":545,"text":"EDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":607,"end":633,"text":"electrochemical deposition","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":639,"end":648,"text":"thickness","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":650,"end":660,"text":"morphology","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":662,"end":669,"text":"optical","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":674,"end":700,"text":"electrochemical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":704,"end":709,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":782,"end":797,"text":"current density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":799,"end":802,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":822,"end":842,"text":"open circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":844,"end":847,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":860,"end":871,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":873,"end":875,"text":"FF","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":889,"end":924,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":967,"end":972,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":993,"end":997,"text":"EDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1048,"end":1058,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1071,"end":1086,"text":"crystallization","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1173,"end":1176,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1181,"end":1216,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1218,"end":1221,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1280,"end":1306,"text":"3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1308,"end":1312,"text":"EDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1361,"end":1370,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1405,"end":1410,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1427,"end":1430,"text":"Jsc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1446,"end":1449,"text":"Voc","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1349,"end":1360,"text":"spin-coated","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1540,"end":1551,"text":"spin-coated","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1552,"end":1561,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1569,"end":1604,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1668,"end":1673,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1651,"end":1667,"text":"electrodeposited","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1717,"end":1721,"text":"EDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1774,"end":1779,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1757,"end":1773,"text":"electrodeposited","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1814,"end":1823,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1922,"end":1957,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1991,"end":2026,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2046,"end":2055,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2173,"end":2178,"text":"PEDOT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2179,"end":2182,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":2239,"end":2248,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2331,"end":2334,"text":"PSS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":2338,"end":2347,"text":"PEDOT:PSS","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":430,"created_at":"2022-11-14T08:50:28.863319Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:50:28.863319Z","lead_time":552.551}

Two SFMO samples with different ASD concentrations (31% and 14%) were prepared by controlling the different sintering temperature, and then, they were performed several GB modifying treatments. While the ASD remain unchanged, the MR values of both samples were appreciably enhanced since more than thousand times of resistivity had been increased after GB modifying. When compared samples that under the same soaking treatments, the more disorder sample (ASD = 31%) always showed the lower MR value than the ordered (ASD = 14%), regardless of its stronger GB strength.

{"text":"Recently, CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite has drawn much attention in photoelectric fields due to its unique properties, and it is mostly applied to solar cell devices, laser technology, and other research fields. For improving these applications, the absorption and stability of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite are both critical. In this work, we proposed a perovskite absorber consisting of CH3NH3PbI3 and silver nanowires (AgNWs) for broadening its photoelectric applications. Using AgNWs, the combined perovskite material had a 5.3-fold enhancement in the absorption coefficient relative to that of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, which is comparable to the enhancement observed for CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with ZnO nanorod arrays. In addition to absorption enhancement, the perovskite absorber also showed good long-term stability. Optical absorption measurements revealed that the electromagnetic field induced by the AgNWs increased the diffusion velocity of excitons and decreased exciton recombination, and the enhanced effect varied with the AgNWs content. Compared to other CH3NH3PbI3 absorber materials, the CH3NH3PbI3-AgNWs complex showed a higher performance due to the higher density of electrons around perovskite. Our work paved the road to the designing of the CH3NH3PbI3-based complex, for improving the performance of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite and further its applications in optoelectronics.","meta":{"doi":"803326"},"tokens":[[{"start":10,"end":20,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":21,"end":31,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":139,"end":157,"text":"solar cell devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":159,"end":175,"text":"laser technology","annotation":"APL"},{"start":257,"end":266,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":270,"end":280,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":281,"end":291,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":339,"end":349,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":373,"end":383,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":432,"end":458,"text":"photoelectric applications","annotation":"APL"},{"start":388,"end":404,"text":"silver nanowires","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":406,"end":411,"text":"AgNWs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":466,"end":471,"text":"AgNWs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":486,"end":496,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":540,"end":562,"text":"absorption coefficient","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":583,"end":594,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3 ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":594,"end":604,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":658,"end":668,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":669,"end":679,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":685,"end":688,"text":"ZnO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":689,"end":696,"text":"nanorod","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":748,"end":758,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":795,"end":804,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":893,"end":898,"text":"AgNWs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1021,"end":1026,"text":"AgNWs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1054,"end":1064,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1089,"end":1105,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3-AgNWs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1106,"end":1113,"text":"complex","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1188,"end":1198,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1248,"end":1258,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1265,"end":1272,"text":"complex","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1307,"end":1317,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1318,"end":1328,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":428,"created_at":"2022-11-14T08:39:21.428969Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:39:21.428969Z","lead_time":415.547}

{"text":"Halide exchange offers a versatile way to modify the properties of halide perovskites, but it is particularly challenging to slow the reaction rate to restrain defect growth in the products. Herein, we propose a slow halide exchange strategy to simultaneously fine-tune the optical and microstructural characteristics of CsPbIBr2 films by physically pairing CsPbIBr2 and CH3NH3PbI3 films. Once a proper heating treatment is applied, halide exchange of Br− and I− ions between the films is activated, and the reaction rate can be well controlled by the heating recipe, in which a high temperature can accelerate the exchange reaction, while a low temperature slows or stops it. By using an optimal halide exchange temperature (110°C) and time (2 h), the parent CsPbIBr2 film was transformed into high-quality CsPbI1+xBr2−x film, featuring an extended absorption onset from 590 to 625 nm, coarsened grains, improved crystallinity, reduced surface roughness, suppressed halide phase segregation, and identical stability to the pristine film. Accordingly, the efficiency of a carbon-based, all-inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) was boosted to 10.94%, which was much higher than that of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film (8.21%). The CsPbI1+xBr2−x PSC also possessed excellent tolerance against heat and moisture stresses.","meta":{"doi":"803324"},"tokens":[[{"start":67,"end":85,"text":"halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":321,"end":329,"text":"CsPbIBr2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":330,"end":335,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":358,"end":366,"text":"CsPbIBr2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":371,"end":381,"text":"CH3NH3PbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":382,"end":387,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"Halide exchange","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":217,"end":241,"text":"halide exchange strategy","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":452,"end":455,"text":"Br−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":460,"end":462,"text":"I−","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":480,"end":485,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":760,"end":768,"text":"CsPbIBr2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":769,"end":773,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":808,"end":821,"text":"CsPbI1+xBr2−x","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":822,"end":826,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":914,"end":927,"text":"crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":937,"end":954,"text":"surface roughness","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":967,"end":991,"text":"halide phase segregation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1007,"end":1016,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1033,"end":1037,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1072,"end":1078,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1100,"end":1121,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1123,"end":1126,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1199,"end":1207,"text":"CsPbIBr2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1208,"end":1213,"text":"film ","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1226,"end":1239,"text":"CsPbI1+xBr2−x","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1240,"end":1243,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":426,"created_at":"2022-11-14T08:17:41.468429Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:17:41.468429Z","lead_time":208.627}
{"text":"To overcome water instability and low photocatalytic activity of lead-free halide perovskite for the degradation of organic dyes, we report a novel photocatalyst of lead-free halide perovskite with Na incorporation and employ it for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in water solution under visible light irradiation. The main purpose of this work is to confirm the feasibility of lead-free halide perovskite with Na incorporation for improving the photocatalytic efficiency and recyclability in water solution and further to explore the mechanism behind the enhancement of photocatalytic performance after Na incorporation. The results show that Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6 can increase the dye degradation rate by at least 50% than the lead-free halide perovskite (Cs2AgInCl6) and the photocatalyst of Ag substituted by Na (Cs2NaInCl6). The degradation efficiency of rhodamine 6G catalyzed by Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6 reaches 94.94% over 60 min, which is 72% higher than that catalyzed by Cs2NaInCl6 and 27% higher than that catalyzed by Cs2AgInCl6. What’s more, the degradation efficiency of methyl orange catalyzed by Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6 is 90.39% within 150 min, which is 66% higher than that catalyzed by Cs2NaInCl6 and 54% higher than that catalyzed by Cs2AgInCl6. Moreover, the photocatalyst of Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6 exhibits a desirable recyclability by water exposure, retaining the degradation efficiency over 90% after five cycles. The strengthened photocatalytic performance in the presence of Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6 is ascribed to an increase of radiative recombination rate and an improvement of average lifetime to 204 ns since an appropriate Na incorporation at the atomic ratio of Na/Ag=4:6 breaks the original crystal lattice and meanwhile increases the electron and hole overlap. The work proves a great potential of halide perovskite with Na incorporation for the highly efficient photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes in water solution.","meta":{"doi":"803323"},"tokens":[[{"start":18,"end":29,"text":"instability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":38,"end":61,"text":"photocatalytic activity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":65,"end":92,"text":"lead-free halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":148,"end":161,"text":"photocatalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":165,"end":192,"text":"lead-free halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":198,"end":200,"text":"Na","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":237,"end":263,"text":"photocatalytic degradation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":394,"end":421,"text":"lead-free halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":427,"end":429,"text":"Na","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":462,"end":487,"text":"photocatalytic efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":492,"end":505,"text":"recyclability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":620,"end":622,"text":"Na","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":587,"end":613,"text":"photocatalytic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":660,"end":680,"text":"Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":744,"end":771,"text":"lead-free halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":773,"end":783,"text":"Cs2AgInCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":793,"end":806,"text":"photocatalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":810,"end":812,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":828,"end":843,"text":"Na (Cs2NaInCl6)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":849,"end":871,"text":"degradation efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":901,"end":921,"text":"Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":993,"end":1003,"text":"Cs2NaInCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1042,"end":1052,"text":"Cs2AgInCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1071,"end":1093,"text":"degradation efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1097,"end":1110,"text":"methyl orange","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1124,"end":1144,"text":"Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1214,"end":1224,"text":"Cs2NaInCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1263,"end":1273,"text":"Cs2AgInCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1289,"end":1302,"text":"photocatalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1306,"end":1326,"text":"Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1395,"end":1417,"text":"degradation efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1463,"end":1489,"text":"photocatalytic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1509,"end":1529,"text":"Cs2Ag0.60Na0.40InCl6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1659,"end":1661,"text":"Na","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1699,"end":1701,"text":"Na","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1702,"end":1704,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1837,"end":1854,"text":"halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1860,"end":1862,"text":"Na","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1902,"end":1928,"text":"photocatalytic degradation","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":425,"created_at":"2022-11-14T08:14:11.558142Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T08:14:11.558142Z","lead_time":232.434}
{"text":"The double perovskite oxide Dy2CoMnO6 (DCMO) has been synthesized by the sol‒gel citrate method in the form of nanoparticles with an average particle size of 110 ± 5 nm as obtained from TEM measurement. The Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern suggests monoclinic P21/n crystal structure. The band gap of the material of 1.93 eV is obtained from the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. The X-ray photoemission spectroscopic study reveals the multiple oxidation states of Co and Mn in DCMO. The photocatalytic behavior of DCMO is evaluated by the photodegradation of rhodamine-B (Rh-B) under the visible light irradiation. The results indicate that DCMO nanoparticles exhibit remarkable photocatalytic efficiency by degrading the Rh-B almost 98% in 4 h. The Mott–Schottky experiment suggests the p-type semiconducting nature of DCMO.

By changing the halide ratio in perovskite precursor solutions that emulsified in microfluidic devices, a series of PQDs with different colors have been successfully fabricated, which made them ideal materials as barcodes. Because of the stable encapsulation of ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) resin, the PQD-encapsulated barcode particles were with no cytotoxicity and could be anti-quenched. It was demonstrated for the first time that the PQD-encapsutated barcode particles by microfluidics were valuable for multiplex biomolecular encoding and assays.

Here, a modified two-step solvothermal method is developed for the synthesis of self-assembled cubic CsPbBr3 NW arrays. This method provides facile access to continuous and uniform ultrafine perovskite NWs and well-aligned pure perovskite NW arrayed architectures. Under excitation at 365 nm, the CsPbBr3 NWs give a strong blue emission observable to the naked eyes. The CsPbBr3 NWs also exhibit strong two-photon excited luminescence under the irradiation with an 800 nm pulse laser. By rotating the polarization angle of the 800 nm laser, strong polarization dependence with a polarization degree up to ∼0.49 is demonstrated in the self-assembled CsPbBr3 NW array, although the CsPbBr3 NWs have an isotropic cubic structure. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this polarization-dependent emission is correlated with the anisotropic charge density distribution of the perovskite NWs. These findings suggest that the ultrafine CsPbBr3 NWs with a well-defined self-assembled architecture could be applied as next-generation polarization-sensitive photoelectronic detection materials.","meta":{"doi":"803319"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":15,"text":"One-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":17,"end":19,"text":"1D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":21,"end":44,"text":"metal halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":45,"end":53,"text":"nanowire","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":55,"end":57,"text":"NW","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":76,"end":97,"text":"absorption efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":99,"end":113,"text":"emission yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":118,"end":138,"text":"dielectric constants","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":151,"end":188,"text":"anisotropic optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":216,"end":233,"text":"energy harvesting","annotation":"APL"},{"start":235,"end":255,"text":"flexible electronics","annotation":"APL"},{"start":261,"end":287,"text":"biomedical imaging devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":297,"end":334,"text":"modified two-step solvothermal method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":384,"end":389,"text":"cubic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":390,"end":397,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":398,"end":400,"text":"NW","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":480,"end":490,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":491,"end":494,"text":"NWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":517,"end":527,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":528,"end":530,"text":"NW","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":586,"end":593,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":594,"end":597,"text":"NWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":660,"end":667,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":668,"end":671,"text":"NWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":938,"end":945,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":946,"end":948,"text":"NW","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":969,"end":976,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":977,"end":980,"text":"NWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":989,"end":1004,"text":"isotropic cubic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1025,"end":1069,"text":"density functional theory (DFT) calculations","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1178,"end":1188,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1189,"end":1192,"text":"NWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1236,"end":1243,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1244,"end":1247,"text":"NWs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1332,"end":1390,"text":"polarization-sensitive photoelectronic detection materials","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":421,"created_at":"2022-11-14T07:44:00.836385Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T07:44:00.836385Z","lead_time":17209.415}
{"text":"In recent years, three-dimensional hybrid perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3) with X = Cl, Br and I, due to their simple production methods and encouraging energy conversion efficiency in perovskite-based solar cells, have raised great attention. One of the main limitations in the development and application of these structures is the toxicity of lead. Investigation of the magnetic and optical properties including linear and nonlinear properties of lead-free organic–inorganic perovskites seems to be necessary. The main focus of this work is the iron substitutions at the lead site. Three-dimensional CH3NH3FeCl3 organic–inorganic perovskite and two-dimensional hybrids, (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2FeCl4 and (C6H5(CH2)2NH3)2FeCl4, were prepared. Firstly, we describe the synthesis method, crystal structure and magnetic behavior of the iron-based lead-free perovskites. Optical properties including linear and nonlinear behavior of the iron halide perovskites are also investigated. The results indicate the presence of iron oxide phase between the layers of (PEA)2FeCl4 perovskite structure and a superparamagnetic behavior with weak magnetization. Through the Z-scan approach, we observed high nonlinear optical response and high nonlinear refraction. The organic cation effect on the nonlinear absorption and nonlinear refraction is studied experimentally. The remarkable third-order nonlinear thermo-optical properties of quasi-2D/3D iron-based lead-free perovskites suggest the potential of these materials for photonics applications.","meta":{"doi":"803318"},"tokens":[[{"start":17,"end":34,"text":"three-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":35,"end":53,"text":"hybrid perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":54,"end":88,"text":"(CH3NH3PbX3) with X = Cl, Br and I","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":145,"end":173,"text":"energy conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":177,"end":205,"text":"perovskite-based solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":338,"end":342,"text":"lead","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":365,"end":373,"text":"magnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":378,"end":396,"text":"optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":442,"end":481,"text":"lead-free organic–inorganic perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":577,"end":594,"text":"Three-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":595,"end":607,"text":"CH3NH3FeCl3 ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":640,"end":655,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":656,"end":663,"text":"hybrids","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":665,"end":685,"text":"(CH3(CH2)3NH3)2FeCl4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":690,"end":711,"text":"(C6H5(CH2)2NH3)2FeCl4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":818,"end":850,"text":"iron-based lead-free perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":852,"end":870,"text":"Optical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":918,"end":941,"text":"iron halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1002,"end":1012,"text":"iron oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1041,"end":1052,"text":"(PEA)2FeCl4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1053,"end":1063,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1031,"end":1037,"text":"layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1080,"end":1106,"text":"superparamagnetic behavior","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1144,"end":1159,"text":"Z-scan approach","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1178,"end":1204,"text":"nonlinear optical response","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1214,"end":1234,"text":"nonlinear refraction","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1269,"end":1289,"text":"nonlinear absorption","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1294,"end":1314,"text":"nonlinear refraction","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1408,"end":1419,"text":"quasi-2D/3D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1420,"end":1451,"text":"iron-based lead-free perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1498,"end":1520,"text":"photonics applications","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":420,"created_at":"2022-11-14T02:57:09.119114Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T02:57:09.119114Z","lead_time":1056.209}
{"text":"Optical design and management are the most important to demonstrate the full potential of thin-film perovskite absorbers. The main goal of this research work is to evaluate the parasitic absorption of nano-particles inside the perovskite absorber. Here, the cylindrical shape nanoparticles are used to manage the incident light inside the perovskite solar cell. Thin-film perovskite absorbers have good absorption in the visible region. Since the small size nanoparticles scatter incident light in the forward direction, so using them on the top side is beneficial. For the rear side, large nanoparticles are used because they scatter in the backward direction. It is showed that the use of nanoparticles in the top side has a weak effect on absorption. So, we used nano-cylinders on the rear side to promote the optical response in the near-infrared region. Comprehensive finite-difference time-domain simulations are done to design optimized nanostructures. It is investigated that optical absorption inside the nano-cylinders occurs at the near-infrared. The parasitic absorption of them was subtracted from total absorption to identify the net absorption of the perovskite layer. For instance, for a 200 nm absorber, the photocurrent is increased from 17.71 mA/cm2 (without nanoparticle) to 19.67 mA/cm2. Also, it is investigated that the absorption inside the Al nanoparticles is less than Ag nanoparticles.

The x-ray diffraction pattern suggests the presence of a polycrystalline BaSnO3 cubic phase. Rietveld analysis was carried out with General Structure and Analysis System II software. A tiny nanorod-like growth pattern was observed when the Ni doping concentration is increased to 2 mol%. Raman analysis, x-ray photoelectron spectral studies, and electron spin resonance studies revealed the presence of oxygen vacancies. The substitution of tin by nickel ions and the presence of oxygen deficiency in the material can be the reason for the observed increase in magnetic moment with Ni doping. The nonlinear optical property obtained from the Z scan (open aperture) studies revealed the optical limiting nature of the synthesized samples. The observed nonlinear optical process in the prepared materials has potential applications in optical limiters and eye-protecting devices.

{"text":"All-inorganic perovskite solar cells suffer from low performance due to unsatisfactory carrier transport and light harvesting efficiency. Semiconductor nanopillar arrays can reduce light reflection loss and suppress exciton recombination dynamics in optoelectronic devices. In all-inorganic perovskite solar cells, few studies employing TiO2 nanopillar arrays (TiO2 NaPAs) have been reported to improve the device performance. Herein, well-arranged TiO2 NaPAs are chosen to enhance the interfacial contact between perovskite and electron transporting layers for improving the carrier transport. Notably, TiO2 NaPAs can be directly fabricated on rigid/flexible substrates at roughly room temperature by unique glancing angle deposition, which is more available than high-temperature hydrothermal/solvothermal methods. By embedding TiO2 NaPAs into chemical processable CsPbI2Br layers, continuous and intimate films are readily formed, guaranteeing large physical contact for facilitating more effective electron injection and charge separation. The vertically grown TiO2 NaPAs also provide a straightforward electron transporting path to electrodes. In addition, TiO2 NaPAs can guide the incident light and enhance the light-harvesting ability of CsPbI2Br films. As a result, the solar cell with TiO2 NaPAs displays a power conversion efficiency of 11.35% higher than planar control of 10.04%, and exhibits better long-term thermal stability. This strategy provides an opportunity by constructing direct interfacial regulation towards the performance improvement of inorganic perovskite solar cells.","meta":{"doi":"5"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":36,"text":"All-inorganic perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":5,"created_at":"2022-11-12T17:36:06.761446Z","updated_at":"2022-11-12T17:36:06.761446Z","lead_time":1953.796}

{"text":"Abstractp-i-n structured semitransparent perovskite solar cells have already been established as promising energy harvesting devices for building-integrated photovoltaics and flexible solar cells due to high transparency and low-cost fabrication. In this study, solution based p-i-n structured semitransparent perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been developed using thin silver (Ag), zinc oxide (ZnO), and aluminium (Al)-doped ZnO nanoparticles (AZO) as buffer layers in addition to PCBM as an electron transport layer (ETL). The thickness of the ZnO and AZO layers are around ~100 nm. In the case of the thin Ag layer, poor interfacial band alignment and less transparency yield device performance with an inferior PCE of 2.53% when illuminated from the top electrode side. On the contrary, Al-doped ZnO possesses excellent optoelectronic performance as a buffer layer for their better electronic conductivity and interfacial band alignment and yield a photovoltaic device characteristic with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.87% when illuminated from the top electrode side, whereas the standard device with a metal electrode shows a PCE of 6.4%. The semitransparent device also has an average transparency of 21.8% in the visible region.Inverted structure semitransparent perovskite solar cells have been developed for flexible and building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. Solution processed perovskite solar cells with a power conversation efficiency of 5.87% and visible transmittance of 21.8% make an excellent candidate for BIPV and smart windows.

{"text":"Recent achievements in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have led to the efficiency of perovskite solar cells about 25.6% but the instability of the device is still a major concern in this era. In this work, owing to the better stability and optical properties the mixed cation lead mixed halide perovskite, FA0.85Cs0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 has been chosen as the absorber layer while SnO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD are employed as electron transport layer and hole transport layer (HTL). The numerical simulation of the device structure FTO/SnO2/FA0.85Cs0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au was carried out using SCAPS-1D software. The power conversion efficiency of PSC is 15.36% obtained which is close to the experimentally reported value. To improve the stability and performance of FA0.85Cs0.15Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 based PSC various organic and inorganic HTLs were employed in place of Spiro-OMeTAD as its oxidation causes instability in the device.

The device with MoO3 delivered the maximum fill factor of 76.49% and short-circuit current (JSC) of 21.38 mA cm−2, but suffered from the lower open-circuit voltage (VOC) compared to a device containing spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT. However, charge recombination and losses at interfaces between layers are two main factors that restrict cell performance. In this study, it is shown that MoO3 not only passivates the interfacial traps, but also enhances the charge extraction of the device.

{"text":"Hybrid organolead halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention due to their recent success as high efficiency solar cell materials and their fascinating material properties uniquely suitable for optoelectronic devices. However, the poor ambient and operational stability as well as the concern of lead toxicity greatly hamper their practical utilization. In this work, crystalline, all-inorganic and lead-free Cs3Sb2I9 perovskite microplates are successfully synthesized by a two-step chemical vapor deposition method. As compared with other typical lead-free perovskite materials, the Cs3Sb2I9 microplates demonstrate excellent optoelectronic properties, including substantial enhancements in the Stokes shift, exciton binding energy and electron-phonon coupling. Simple photoconductive devices fabricated using these microplates exhibit an ultra-fast response with the rise and decay time constants down to 96 and 58 µs, respectively.

Importantly, these photodetectors show superior thermal stability in a wide temperature range, capable to function reversibly between 80 and 380 K, indicating their robustness to operate under both low and high temperatures.

However, the relatively low conductivity and high-density surface trap states of NiOx severely limit device performance in solar cell applications. Interfacial engineering is an efficient approach to achieve remarkable hole-transporting performance by surface passivation. Herein, the efficient NiOx hole transport layer was prepared by surface passivation engineering strategy via facile solution processes with cesium iodide (CsI). It is demonstrated that CsI plays a super-effective dual-function role in inverted solar cell device: On one hand, the presence of CsI hugely passivates the surface trap states at the NiOx/perovskite interface along with obviously improved conductivity by the incorporated Cs+; on the other hand, the ions immigration is significantly suppressed by the presence of I ion for high-quality perovskite films, resulting in a stable contact interface. The ameliorative interface leads to largely reduced carrier non-radiative recombination, attributing to boosted carrier extraction efficiency. As a result, decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.48% with a noticeable fill factor (FF) beyond 80% was achieved.

However, the low photoluminescence (PL) intensity of pristine Cs2AgInCl6 limits its practical applications. In this study, a series of Cs2AgIn1−γ−xBixLaγCl6 NCs were synthesized to break the parity-forbidden transition and modify the associated optical functionalities. A broadband bright warm-white emission in the visible region was achieved, with an excellent PL quantum yield of 60%. The dynamic mechanism, involving ultrafast transient absorption, suggests that high-efficiency PL is induced by triplet self-trapping exciton emission. The incorporation of La3+-Bi3+ facilitated the singlet-triplet transition by increasing the lifetime and quickening the intersystem crossing process.

{"text":"Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) require ligands on their surfaces to passivate defects and prevent aggregation. However, the ligands construct the interface relationship between the PQDs, which may seriously hinder the carrier transport. Hence, we propose a molecular engineering strategy of using 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) to perfectly solve this problem, benefiting from its high conjugation and passivation ability to CsPbBr3 PQDs. Furthermore, EDOT on the surface of PQDs can be in-situ polymerized under the photocurrent of the photodetector, thus interconnecting the PQDs which enhanced the performance of the photodetectors up to 178% of its initial performance. We have thoroughly investigated the electropolymerization process of EDOT and its passivation effect on PQDs. The simple lateral photodetector based on EDOT PQDs exhibits a high responsivity of 11.96 A/W, which is 104 times higher than that of oleic acid caped PQDs. Due to the protection of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), the photodetector prepared from EDOT PQDs exhibited very high stability, retaining 94% of its performance after six months in air.

The microfibers were generated by introducing PeQDs precursors into each barrel of the inner capillary array and mixing them in the spindle middle channel, where the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) dissolved in N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) was also injected as their sheath fluid. During this process, the PeQDs were in situ synthesized with the connection of precursor cations and anions in the core fluid; while the PVDF formed solidified microfibers to encapsulate PeQDs with the fast dispersion of DMF into the outer aqueous solution. Thus, the good encapsulation of PeQDs was achieved in PVDF microfibers, which effectively protected them from different hostile environments. Because of the highly tunable spinning processes, the microfibers exhibited controllable diameters and helical geometric structures, and the encapsulated PeQDs could yield adjustable emission peaks.

Their elastic property and mechanical robustness become the key factors for device applications under realistic service conditions with various mechanical loadings. Here, we demonstrate that high tensile elastic strain (∼ 4% to ∼ 5.1%) can be achieved in vapor-liquid-solid-grown single-crystalline CsPbBr3 nanowires through in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) buckling experiments. Such high flexural elasticity can be attributed to the structural defect-scarce, smooth surface, single-crystallinity and nanomechanical size effect of CsPbBr3 nanowires. The mechanical reliability of CsPbBr3 nanowire-based flexible photodetectors was examined by cyclic bending tests, with no noticeable performance deterioration observed after 5,000 cycles.

However, the use of this additive in spiro-OMeTAD can induce device instability. In this work, a composite HTL without harmful additives is proposed for a stable n-i-p structured PSC. The prepared nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles were first sprayed on perovskite film to form a porous NiO film, and spiro-OMeTAD solution was then filled in to construct composite HTL. The PSC using this composite HTL presents better photovoltaic performance than that using NiO and pristine spiro-OMeTAD, respectively, and also exhibits a much better working stability, retaining more than 82% of the initial performance after 200 h in air. We deduce that the enhanced charge transfer at the HTL/Perovskite interface could be induced by the synergistic effect between spiro-OMeTAD and NiO.

Most experimental results to-date have been made using loose powder and cold-pressed pellets (i.e. green bodies). Straightforward sintering methods to achieve dense ceramics are challenging because BaZrS3 decomposes and oxidizes in air above 550 °C. Here, we take inspiration from the cold-sintering process to develop a low-to-intermediate densification process for chalcogenide perovskites. Typical additives for cold sintering of oxides do not accelerate BaZrS3 sintering. At higher temperature, iodine is remarkably successful as an additive to accelerate densification. We achieve density up to 92% for sintering at 450 °C and 425 MPa. Our sintering process does not cause significant oxidation. Thermogravimetric measurements reveal the formation of an intergranular phase.

{"text":"A strategic option for the production of H2 from renewable resources is use of the ethanol steam reforming reaction. Catalysts based on nickel have been widely investigated for this reaction, offering the advantages of low cost and high activity. However, a difficulty is that nickel may be strongly deactivated by coke formation. Perovskite-type mixed oxides are promising precursors for nickel-based catalysts, since their reduction leads to the formation of highly dispersed metal particles that can mitigate carbon deposition. However, high calcination temperatures are required for perovskite structure formation, resulting in low surface areas and limiting the effectiveness of this method. In order to address this difficulty, the present work proposes a novel strategy whereby the perovskite-type oxide LaNiO3 is supported on SBA-15. Characterization of the catalysts was performed using XRF, XRD, SEM, TPR, TEM, BET, H2-TPD, and TGA techniques. Their performances were then evaluated in catalysis of the ethanol steam reforming reaction to produce hydrogen. Calcination at 750 °C resulted in formation of highly dispersed perovskite on a support that presented high specific surface area. The catalyst obtained from reduced LaNiO3/SBA-15 with 33 wt% perovskite was the most active in the reaction. Analyses using TGA and SEM showed the formation of carbon mainly over Ni catalysts obtained from bulk LaNiO3 perovskite, while supporting LaNiO3 on SBA-15 led to lower deposition of carbon. The superior performance of this material in catalysis could be attributed to the dispersion of the perovskite on SBA-15, resulting in smaller size of the Ni metal particles formed during the reduction, compared to the catalyst derived from bulk perovskite. This promising method could be used in the production of a wide range of other catalysts.","meta":{"doi":"803269"},"tokens":[[{"start":41,"end":43,"text":"H2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":83,"end":115,"text":"ethanol steam reforming reaction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":117,"end":126,"text":"Catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":136,"end":142,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":277,"end":283,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":331,"end":341,"text":"Perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":389,"end":395,"text":"nickel","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":402,"end":411,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":512,"end":518,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":587,"end":597,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":789,"end":799,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":811,"end":817,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":866,"end":875,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":896,"end":899,"text":"XRF","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":901,"end":904,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":906,"end":909,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":911,"end":914,"text":"TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":916,"end":919,"text":"TEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":921,"end":924,"text":"BET","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":926,"end":932,"text":"H2-TPD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":938,"end":941,"text":"TGA","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1057,"end":1065,"text":"hydrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1131,"end":1141,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1013,"end":1045,"text":"ethanol steam reforming reaction","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1202,"end":1210,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1233,"end":1239,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1259,"end":1269,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1322,"end":1325,"text":"TGA","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1330,"end":1333,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1358,"end":1364,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1377,"end":1379,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1380,"end":1389,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1409,"end":1415,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1416,"end":1426,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1445,"end":1451,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1489,"end":1495,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1597,"end":1607,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1652,"end":1654,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1716,"end":1724,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1743,"end":1753,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1834,"end":1843,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":376,"created_at":"2022-11-11T07:41:15.180905Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T07:41:15.180905Z","lead_time":748.43}

{"text":"Lead halide perovskites have attracted extensive attention in recent years because of their excellent photoelectronic properties, such as high absorption coefficients, carrier mobilities, defect tolerances, and photoluminescence efficiencies. However, a key issue hindering their commercial application is the toxicity of lead. Replacing lead with other nontoxic elements is a promising solution to this problem. Considering their atomic radii, relative atomic masses, and electron arrangements, perovskites based on Sn, Bi, Sb, and other elements instead of Pb have been widely synthesized. Here, we summarized the growth methods, photoelectric properties, and device applications of these lead-free perovskites. First, we introduced several common growth methods for lead-free perovskites, including solution methods, solid-state reaction, and chemical vapor deposition methods.

{"text":"LiXH3 (X = Cr, Fe, Co, & Zn) hydride type perovskites have been studied by applying density functional theory (DFT), and their structural, optoelectronic, magnetic, hydrogen storage, and mechanical properties have been calculated. The results show that these materials are synthesizable for hydrogen storage applications. The energy band structures as well as total density of states (TDOS) and partial density of states (PDOS) unveil that LiCrH3, LiCoH3, and LiZnH3 possess metallic character, while LiFeH3 exhibits semiconducting behavior. The lattice constants are calculated by applying PBE + GGA functional which are listed as 3.4940, 3.1791, 3.6343, and 3.7132 Å for LiXH3 (X = Cr, Fe, Co, & Zn), respectively. In order to manage the restriction of PBE + GGA functional, the lattice constants are also calculated by applying hybrid HSE06 functional which are found to be 3.3126, 2.9675, 3.1531, and 3.4018 Å for LiCrH3, LiFeH3, LiCoH3, and LiZnH3, respectively. The elastic stiffness constants show that these materials are mechanically and elastically stable and are deemed suitable as transportation materials in hydrogen storage devices. Moreover, mechanical parameters such as Poisson coefficient, Cauchy pressure, melting temperature, Young, Bulk, and Shear moduli have been calculated. Dielectric constants, refractive index, optical conductivity, absorptivity, and energy loss function have been determined to seek an optical behavior of the considered perovskites for hydrogen storage applications.

To simulate ion migration under positive poling we have taken a defect model and reverse the defect polarity for simulating ion migration under negative poling.

{"text":"The application of polymers to replace oleylamine (OLA) and oleic acid (OA) as ligands for perovskite nanocrystals is an effective strategy to improve their stability and durability especially for the solution-based processing. Herein, we report a mechanosynthesis of lead bromide perovskite nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized by partially hydrolyzed poly(methyl methacrylate) (h-PMMA) and high-molecular-weight highly-branched poly(ethylenimine) (PEI-25K). The as-synthesized NP solutions exhibited green emission centered at 516 nm, possessing a narrow full-width at half-maximum of 17 nm and as high photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) as 85%, while showing excellent durability and resistance to polar solvents, e.g., methanol. The colloids of polymer-stabilized NPs were directly processable to form stable and strongly-emitting thin films and solids, making them attractive as gain media. Furthermore, the roles of h-PMMA and PEI-25K in the grinding process were studied in depth. The h-PMMA can form micelles in the grinding solvent of dichloromethane to act as size-regulating templates for the growth of NPs. The PEI-25K with large amounts of amino groups induced significant enrichment of PbBr2 in the reaction mixture, which in turn caused the formation of CsPb2Br5-mPbBr2 and CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6-nCsBr NPs. The presence of CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6-nCsBr NPs was responsible for the high PL QY, as the Cs4PbBr6 phase with a wide energy bandgap can passivate the surface defects of the CsPbBr3 phase. This work describes a direct and facile mechanosynthesis of polymer-coordinated perovskite NPs and promotes in-depth understanding of the formation and phase conversion for perovskite NPs in the grinding process.","meta":{"doi":"803458"},"tokens":[[{"start":39,"end":49,"text":"oleylamine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":51,"end":54,"text":"OLA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":60,"end":70,"text":"oleic acid","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":72,"end":74,"text":"OA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":91,"end":101,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":102,"end":114,"text":"nanocrystals","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":157,"end":166,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":171,"end":181,"text":"durability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":201,"end":226,"text":"solution-based processing","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":268,"end":280,"text":"lead bromide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":281,"end":291,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":292,"end":305,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":307,"end":310,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":374,"end":380,"text":"h-PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":336,"end":372,"text":"hydrolyzed poly(methyl methacrylate)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":424,"end":442,"text":"poly(ethylenimine)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":444,"end":451,"text":"PEI-25K","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":473,"end":475,"text":"NP","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":599,"end":630,"text":"photoluminescence quantum yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":632,"end":637,"text":"PL QY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":671,"end":681,"text":"durability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":722,"end":730,"text":"methanol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":767,"end":770,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":834,"end":844,"text":"thin films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":921,"end":927,"text":"h-PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":932,"end":939,"text":"PEI-25K","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":991,"end":997,"text":"h-PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1113,"end":1116,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1043,"end":1058,"text":"dichloromethane","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1122,"end":1129,"text":"PEI-25K","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1199,"end":1204,"text":"PbBr2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1268,"end":1283,"text":"CsPb2Br5-mPbBr2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1288,"end":1310,"text":"CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6-nCsBr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1311,"end":1314,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1332,"end":1354,"text":"CsPbBr3-Cs4PbBr6-nCsBr","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1355,"end":1358,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1388,"end":1393,"text":"PL QY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1402,"end":1410,"text":"Cs4PbBr6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1429,"end":1443,"text":"energy bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1462,"end":1477,"text":"surface defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1485,"end":1492,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1580,"end":1590,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1673,"end":1683,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1591,"end":1594,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1684,"end":1687,"text":"NPs","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":559,"created_at":"2022-11-17T08:16:19.603966Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T08:16:19.603966Z","lead_time":340.917}

{"text":"This study entails a theoretical investigation of the effect of the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL) materials on a lead-free perovskite solar cell based on methylammonium tin iodide (CH3NH3SnI3). The simulations of the solar cells were conducted with the aid of the one-dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator, SCAPS-1D. The initial primary cell with the following architectural design: glass/FTO/WS2/CH3NH3SnI3/P3HT/Au, was simulated to yield a modest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.47%. In an attempt to improve the PCE of this device, several materials were tested as the HTL, and their effects on the PCE were simulated. Subsequently, various ETL materials were tested with what were found to be the best possible HTL materials. The PCE of the primary device increased from 10.47% to over 16% with the utilization of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis [N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN), copper(I) iodide (CuI), and poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno-[3,2-b]thiophene) (D-PBTTT-14) as HTLs. Tungsten disulfide (WS2) was shown to be the best suitable ETL material. The density of defects of the absorber for the devices with tungsten disulfide as the ETL and Cu2O, D-PBTTT-4, CuSCN, spiro-OMeTAD, and CuI as the HTLs, was best at 1.5 × 1017 cm−3, while for the primary device, the best value of the density of defects was 1.5 × 1014 cm−3. Furthermore, the energy barriers at the interface for primary and optimum devices was examined. Additionally, the effect of the external operating temperature on the performance of the devices was investigated. The simulation results allow one to propose the best HTL and ETL materials for high performance of lead-free perovskite solar cells, based on tin.","meta":{"doi":"803456"},"tokens":[[{"start":68,"end":88,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":90,"end":93,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":99,"end":123,"text":"electron transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":125,"end":128,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":145,"end":154,"text":"lead-free","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":155,"end":176,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":186,"end":211,"text":"methylammonium tin iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":213,"end":223,"text":"CH3NH3SnI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":249,"end":260,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":296,"end":311,"text":"one-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":312,"end":322,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":346,"end":354,"text":"SCAPS-1D","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":422,"end":427,"text":"glass","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":428,"end":431,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":432,"end":435,"text":"WS2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":436,"end":446,"text":"CH3NH3SnI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":447,"end":451,"text":"P3HT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":452,"end":454,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":488,"end":515,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":517,"end":520,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":562,"end":565,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":619,"end":622,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":649,"end":652,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":691,"end":694,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":762,"end":765,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":781,"end":784,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":865,"end":935,"text":"2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis [N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":937,"end":949,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":952,"end":967,"text":"copper(I) oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":969,"end":973,"text":"Cu2O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":976,"end":997,"text":"copper(I) thiocyanate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":999,"end":1004,"text":"CuSCN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1007,"end":1023,"text":"copper(I) iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1025,"end":1028,"text":"CuI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1035,"end":1098,"text":"poly(2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno-[3,2-b]thiophene)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1100,"end":1110,"text":"D-PBTTT-14","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1115,"end":1119,"text":"HTLs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1121,"end":1139,"text":"Tungsten disulfide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1141,"end":1144,"text":"WS2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1180,"end":1183,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1198,"end":1216,"text":"density of defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1280,"end":1283,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1288,"end":1292,"text":"Cu2O","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1294,"end":1303,"text":"D-PBTTT-4","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1305,"end":1310,"text":"CuSCN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1312,"end":1324,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1330,"end":1333,"text":"CuI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1341,"end":1345,"text":"HTLs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1428,"end":1446,"text":"density of defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1485,"end":1500,"text":"energy barriers","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1732,"end":1735,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1740,"end":1743,"text":"ETL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1778,"end":1787,"text":"lead-free","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1788,"end":1810,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1821,"end":1824,"text":"tin","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":557,"created_at":"2022-11-17T08:05:18.004387Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T08:05:18.004387Z","lead_time":296.02}

As the core of the full-spectrum UOC system, photodetectors (PDs) are plagued by stringent requirements including a broadband response, intrinsic water resistance, and a high detectivity. In this work, two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites (HPs) and corresponding PDs are constructed by stearamine (SA), representing the rarely explored long-chain aliphatic amine series, to own waterproofness, ultralow noise, and superior optoelectronic performance, which consequently enable a high suitability for UOC. By dimensionality and composition modulations to extend the absorption onset down to 1.5 eV, a broadband response covering the entire transmission window of water (> 1.55 eV) for full- spectrum UOC can be obtained. Besides, featuring a high responsivity of 3.27 A·W−1, a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 630%, fast rise/decay times of 0.35 ms/0.54 ms, a superior detectivity up to 1.35 × 1012 Jones and the capability to distinguish various waveforms and light intensities, the PDs present sensitive and persistent photoresponse underwater.

By adjusting the refractive index and the film thickness of each layer according to a two-layer model, enhanced glass trans-mittance in a broadband wavelength range can be reached, with the maximum transmittance increasing from ca. 90% to over 95%. With the bilayer ARC, the maximum short-circuit current density and PCE of (FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1-x PSCs can be increased from 25.5 mA cm-2 and 22.7% to 26.5 mA cm-2 and 23.9% with negligible changes in fill factor and open-circuit voltage. This work presents a simple yet effective strategy to enhance the efficiency of solar cells employing bilayer antirefective coatings, which can be applied to other types of solar cells.","meta":{"doi":"803451"},"tokens":[[{"start":9,"end":31,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":33,"end":37,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":65,"end":75,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":81,"end":92,"text":"photon loss","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":203,"end":218,"text":"reflection loss","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":238,"end":265,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":267,"end":270,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":275,"end":279,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":297,"end":319,"text":"antireflective coating","annotation":"APL"},{"start":321,"end":324,"text":"ARC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":289,"end":296,"text":"bilayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":399,"end":421,"text":"(FAPbI3)x-(MAPbBr3)1_x","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":422,"end":426,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":484,"end":494,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":520,"end":527,"text":"bilayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":528,"end":531,"text":"ARC","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":547,"end":561,"text":"silica polymer","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":608,"end":628,"text":"hexamethyldisiloxane","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":629,"end":637,"text":"modified","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":638,"end":648,"text":"mesoporous","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":649,"end":655,"text":"silica","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":656,"end":669,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":676,"end":702,"text":"fluorinated silica polymer","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":822,"end":836,"text":"trans-mittance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":970,"end":973,"text":"ARC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":962,"end":969,"text":"bilayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":987,"end":1016,"text":"short-circuit current density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1021,"end":1024,"text":"PCE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1028,"end":1049,"text":"(FAPbI3)x(MAPbBr3)1-x","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1050,"end":1054,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1153,"end":1164,"text":"fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1169,"end":1189,"text":"open-circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1257,"end":1267,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1271,"end":1282,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1293,"end":1300,"text":"bilayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1301,"end":1323,"text":"antirefective coatings","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1364,"end":1375,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":552,"created_at":"2022-11-17T07:30:56.298597Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T07:30:56.299597Z","lead_time":239.365}

{"text":"All-inorganic cesium lead halide based perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibit promising optoelectronic properties, but their poor stability and anion exchange reaction limit their broad commercial applications. Herein, we demonstrated the successful synthesis of blue-green-red emitting CsPbX3 (X = Cl/Br, Br, and Br/I) PNCs via hot injection method, followed by silica-coating and embedding in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of SiO2/PMMA-coated PNCs can be tuned continuously by regulating precursor composition ratio, from blue (CsPb(Cl0.5/Br0.5)3; 460 nm) to red (CsPb(Br0.4/I0.6)3 via green (CsPbBr3; 519 nm). The PNCs composite films exhibit improved stability (thermal-, moisture-, and photo-stability) because of the barrier formed by SiO2/PMMA coating and also displayed exceptional photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY of blue, green, and red-emitting SiO2/PMMA coated PNCs are 37%, 86%, and 71%, respectively) with longer lifetimes inhibiting anion exchange. Eventually, the PNCs-encapsulated SiO2/PMMA composite films were integrated into the UV LED chip as down-converting materials to construct a prototype white-peLED unit. The designed white-peLED unit demonstrated bright white light generating CIE coordinates (0.349, 0.350), a luminous efficiency (LE) of 39.2% and a color rendering index (CRI) of 84.7. The wide color gamut of 121.47% of NTSC and 98.56% of Rec. 2020 is also achieved with the built w-LED system. Therefore, the results demonstrated that CsPbX3 (X = Cl/Br, Br, and Br/I) PNCs@SiO2/PMMA composite films can be employed as efficient UV to visible color conversion materials for white-LEDs and backlighting.","meta":{"doi":"803449"},"tokens":[[{"start":14,"end":49,"text":"cesium lead halide based perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":50,"end":62,"text":"nanocrystals","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":64,"end":68,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":88,"end":113,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":130,"end":139,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":287,"end":319,"text":"CsPbX3 (X = Cl/Br, Br, and Br/I)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":320,"end":324,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":329,"end":349,"text":"hot injection method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":363,"end":391,"text":"silica-coating and embedding","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":395,"end":419,"text":"poly(methylmethacrylate)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":421,"end":425,"text":"PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":439,"end":469,"text":"photoluminescence (PL) spectra","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":473,"end":477,"text":"SiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":478,"end":482,"text":"PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":483,"end":489,"text":"coated","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":490,"end":494,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":575,"end":593,"text":"CsPb(Cl0.5/Br0.5)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":611,"end":628,"text":"CsPb(Br0.4/I0.6)3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":640,"end":647,"text":"CsPbBr3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":662,"end":666,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":667,"end":676,"text":"composite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":677,"end":682,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":700,"end":709,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":742,"end":751,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":786,"end":790,"text":"SiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":791,"end":795,"text":"PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":835,"end":865,"text":"photoluminescent quantum yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":867,"end":871,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":905,"end":909,"text":"SiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":910,"end":915,"text":"PMMA ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":922,"end":926,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1029,"end":1033,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1047,"end":1051,"text":"SiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1052,"end":1056,"text":"PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1057,"end":1066,"text":"composite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1067,"end":1072,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1034,"end":1046,"text":"encapsulated","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1098,"end":1109,"text":"UV LED chip","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1164,"end":1175,"text":"white-peLED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1195,"end":1206,"text":"white-peLED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1289,"end":1308,"text":"luminous efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1310,"end":1312,"text":"LE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1329,"end":1350,"text":"color rendering index","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1352,"end":1355,"text":"CRI","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1462,"end":1467,"text":"w-LED","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1517,"end":1549,"text":"CsPbX3 (X = Cl/Br, Br, and Br/I)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1550,"end":1554,"text":"PNCs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1555,"end":1559,"text":"SiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1560,"end":1564,"text":"PMMA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1565,"end":1574,"text":"composite","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1575,"end":1580,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1655,"end":1665,"text":"white-LEDs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1670,"end":1682,"text":"backlighting","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":550,"created_at":"2022-11-17T07:24:07.798251Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T07:24:07.798251Z","lead_time":365.477}

{"text":"The revolution represented by third-generation photovoltaic devices relied on the discovery of various hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite materials to convert solar into electrical energy. One of the advantages of such cells is their low cost due to the raw materials and cheap production methods used. Nevertheless, these cells face several challenges, such as inadequate stability and the hysteresis phenomenon. To overcome these, perovskite solar cell (PSCs) with planar and inverted structures have been utilized with an inorganic hole transport layer (HTL), achieving acceptable efficiency. As there is no closed-form system of equations to describe the operation of such cells, neural networks have been employed for their modeling. In optimization algorithms, the values of the parameters must be swept, since most current simulation tools cannot use them directly. Such software optimization can notably decrease the cost of cell design. This paper presents a practical way to achieve the mentioned aim. In particular, an artificial neural network (ANN) is exploited for the modeling, then an evolutionary particle swarm optimization (E-PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the structure to achieve the highest efficiency based on searching the energy conversion. The results of the simulations are then employed in SCAPS software to train the neural network. This optimization leads to the achievement of an efficiency of 23.76% for the proposed structure, better than values reported in literature.","meta":{"doi":"803444"},"tokens":[[{"start":47,"end":67,"text":"photovoltaic devices","annotation":"APL"},{"start":128,"end":138,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":220,"end":225,"text":"cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":324,"end":329,"text":"cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":374,"end":383,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":392,"end":413,"text":"hysteresis phenomenon","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":434,"end":455,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":457,"end":461,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":536,"end":556,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":558,"end":561,"text":"HTL","annotation":"APL"},{"start":585,"end":595,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":678,"end":683,"text":"cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1328,"end":1342,"text":"SCAPS software","annotation":"CMT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":545,"created_at":"2022-11-17T07:03:46.646250Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T07:03:46.646250Z","lead_time":291.146}
{"text":"La2NiMnO6 double perovskite material that simultaneously exhibits both electric and magnetic ordering is used in energy-efficient electronic applications due to its lower power dissipation. The magnetic and electric ordering of Ni and Mn depend on the site occupancy and exchange mechanism driven by the anions, making La2NiMnO6 a widely explored material for such studies. The magnetocaloric properties of A-site-doped (Sr2+, Gd3+) double perovskite La2NiMnO6 have been investigated experimentally. The synthesized samples showed Pbnm orthorhombic symmetry with P21/n configuration. The Curie temperature (TC) of La2NiMnO6 (LMN) increased from 277 K to 284 K upon Gd doping due to strong exchange interactions and long-range ordering of Ni2+/Mn4+. Meanwhile, the Tc of LMN was observed to be 268 K upon Sr2+ doping, suggesting the possibility of antiferromagnetic ordering. Sr2+-doped (hole-doped) LMN showed lower Tc, magnetic entropy, and relative cooling power (RCP), which may be due to the increase in antisite disorder and exchange bias effect. The chemical stability, tunable transition temperature around room temperature with good control over entropy, wider operating temperature range, and high RCP at lower applied magnetic field make LMN and A-site-doped LMN potential refrigerant materials for use in energy-efficient room-temperature magnetic cooling systems.","meta":{"doi":"803443"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":9,"text":"La2NiMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":10,"end":27,"text":"double perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":71,"end":79,"text":"electric","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":84,"end":101,"text":"magnetic ordering","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":171,"end":188,"text":"power dissipation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":194,"end":202,"text":"magnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":207,"end":224,"text":"electric ordering","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":228,"end":230,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":235,"end":237,"text":"Mn","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":319,"end":328,"text":"La2NiMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":378,"end":403,"text":"magnetocaloric properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":421,"end":425,"text":"Sr2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":427,"end":431,"text":"Gd3+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":433,"end":450,"text":"double perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":451,"end":460,"text":"La2NiMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":531,"end":535,"text":"Pbnm","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":536,"end":548,"text":"orthorhombic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":563,"end":568,"text":"P21/n","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":588,"end":605,"text":"Curie temperature","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":614,"end":623,"text":"La2NiMnO6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":625,"end":628,"text":"LMN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":665,"end":667,"text":"Gd","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":738,"end":742,"text":"Ni2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":743,"end":747,"text":"Mn4+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":770,"end":773,"text":"LMN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":804,"end":808,"text":"Sr2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":847,"end":873,"text":"antiferromagnetic ordering","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":875,"end":879,"text":"Sr2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":880,"end":885,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":899,"end":902,"text":"LMN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":920,"end":936,"text":"magnetic entropy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":942,"end":964,"text":"relative cooling power","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":966,"end":969,"text":"RCP","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1056,"end":1074,"text":"chemical stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1207,"end":1210,"text":"RCP","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1248,"end":1251,"text":"LMN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1269,"end":1272,"text":"LMN","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1333,"end":1374,"text":"room-temperature magnetic cooling systems","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1263,"end":1268,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":892,"end":897,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":544,"created_at":"2022-11-17T06:58:38.002182Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T06:58:54.192754Z","lead_time":1143.4209999999998}

This is realized with our efficient colloidal route to synthesize Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs that involve stable and strongly coordinated precursor such as silver-trioctylphosphine complex together with bismuth neodecanoate, which leads to a significantly improved chemical and colloidal stability. Using layer-by-layer solid-state ligand exchange technique, a compact and crack-free thin film of Cs2AgBiBr6 NCs were fabricated.

In this paper a novel approach to stabilize a bismuth halide perovskite [(CH3)2NH2]3[BiI6] (DA3BiI6) in water using dimethylammonium iodide (DAI) without the assistance of acids or coatings is reported. The DA3BiI6 powder exhibits good stability in DAI solutions for at least two weeks. The concentration of DAI is found as a critical parameter, where the I- ions play the key role in the stabilization. The stability of DA3BiI6 in water is realized via a surface dissolution–recrystallization process. Stabilized DA3BiI6 demonstrates constant photocatalytic properties for visible light-induced photo-oxidation of I- ions and with PtCl4 as a co-catalyst (Pt-DA3BiI6), photocatalytic H2 evolution with a rate of 5.7 μmol⋅h-1 from HI in DAI solution, obtaining an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.83% at 535 nm.

They were synthesized using the citrate–nitrate auto-combustion method. The crystal structure and microstructure were refined by applying Rietveld profile refinements using the Maud Program. The morphology, magnetic and optical properties of the inspected samples have been explored using HRTEM, VSM, and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance, respectively. The prepared-samples distortion increases as the substituted RE ionic radius decreases. Iron spins of RE orthoferrite samples are known to be ordered Anti-ferromagnetically (AFM). They also possess weak ferromagnetism due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This feeble ferromagnetism is reflected in their soft behavior, whereas Sm0.7La0.3FeO3 sample exhibits the butterfly shape hysteresis loop. The remnant magnetization, saturation magnetization, and coercivity are relatively small, but sometimes impressively, enhanced through Lanthanum-rare-earth substitution. Introducing rare earth ions into LaFeO3 decreases the Fe–O–Fe angle and the consequent reduction of the super exchange interaction. In particular, the coercivity of Sm0.7La0.3FeO3 is remarkably improved relative to the parent sample. It has the largest coercivity of all the prepared nanoparticles. Due to the aforementioned substitution, a slight reflectance edge red shift is observed in the spectra. The relation between the magnetic properties of the investigated samples and the ionic radii of RE was investigated and discussed.

{"text":"Methyl-ammonium lead iodide-based perovskite materials have been extensively studied for applications in solar cells, which have reached high efficiencies of about 24% in the laboratory. However, being a hybrid (organic–inorganic) material, methyl-ammonium lead iodide can be affected by climatic conditions, such as humidity, light and temperature. While perovskite films have been synthesized, and annealing as part of the fabrication process has been reported, there have been, however, relatively few studies on the effects of temperature when the films, after synthesis, have been intentionally exposed to different temperatures. In this work, a study of the behaviour of perovskite films (MAPbI3) has been conducted exposing the films to different temperatures (25, 40, 50, 60 and 70°C) in small greenhouses. Homogeneous perovskite films were deposited by the anti-solvent method. The films were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and optical absorption.

{"text":"Because of the special low-dimensional physical properties of quantum dots (QDs) and the excellent optoelectronic properties of perovskite, the combination of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and QDs may largely be one of the breakthroughs in device performance. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of the size of QDs on device performance except for bandgap tuning. In this work, non-toxic SnS QDs of different sizes were prepared by varying the reaction temperature of the thermal injection method. Their optical bandgaps with sizes were investigated, and they were implanted into the active layers of the carbon-based PSCs without hole transport layer. The effects of implanting SnS QDs with different sizes on the perovskite film quality and PSCs performance were studied. The cells implanted with SnS QDs of the best size (average 6.9 nm) achieved a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 14.26%, reaching a 12.42% improvement. The improved performance was mainly attributed to the presence of SnS QDs, which provided more nucleation sites for the growth of perovskite grains, and contributed to better quality perovskite films (including higher crystallinity, increased grain numbers and fewer surface defects), thus improving the light utilization, accelerating carrier transfer and reducing carrier recombination in the active layers. The successful implantation of QDs with different sizes in this paper has facilitated the development of the combination of perovskite and QDs in mesoporous PSC.","meta":{"doi":"803434"},"tokens":[[{"start":23,"end":38,"text":"low-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":39,"end":58,"text":"physical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":62,"end":74,"text":"quantum dots","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":76,"end":79,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":99,"end":124,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":128,"end":138,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":159,"end":181,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":183,"end":187,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":193,"end":196,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":329,"end":332,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":366,"end":373,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":406,"end":409,"text":"SnS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":410,"end":413,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":490,"end":514,"text":"thermal injection method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":522,"end":538,"text":"optical bandgaps","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":602,"end":615,"text":"active layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":623,"end":629,"text":"carbon","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":630,"end":635,"text":"based","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":636,"end":640,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":649,"end":669,"text":"hole transport layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":697,"end":700,"text":"SnS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":701,"end":704,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":733,"end":743,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":744,"end":748,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":761,"end":765,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":796,"end":801,"text":"cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":817,"end":820,"text":"SnS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":821,"end":824,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":870,"end":905,"text":"photoelectric conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1014,"end":1017,"text":"SnS","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1018,"end":1021,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1078,"end":1088,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1131,"end":1141,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1142,"end":1147,"text":"films","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1166,"end":1179,"text":"crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1215,"end":1230,"text":"surface defects","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1284,"end":1300,"text":"carrier transfer","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1314,"end":1335,"text":"carrier recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1343,"end":1356,"text":"active layers","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1389,"end":1392,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1482,"end":1492,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1497,"end":1500,"text":"QDs","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1515,"end":1518,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":535,"created_at":"2022-11-16T10:59:38.513002Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T10:59:38.513002Z","lead_time":194.945}

{"text":"In this work, the quaternary nanostructure La0.8−xCexAg0.2MnO3 perovskite was synthetized by conventional solid-state method and calcination in air at 900 °C for 24 h. These materials are one member of perovskite-containing manganite, and rare earths and Alkali elements in A and B sites, respectively. The effect of La substitution on the crystallite size and microstrain of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) line broadening is analyzed in different methods. Scanning electron microscope measurements are combined with an energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDX) to illustrate the effect of cerium (Ce) atoms adding. Scherrer, Williamson–Hall and size-strain plot methods were used to analyze the line profile of XRD and Rietveld refinement by Fullprof software to determine microstructure parameters of perovskite. The results obtained showed that with the addition of the Ce element, there is no effect on the lattice parameters, which supports the replacement of Ce ions with those of La ion in the unit cell. In addition, the crystal size microstrain and porosity values were systematically decreased with increasing Ce-ion concentrations. The analysis of the surface morphology shows that the process leads to the formation of smaller nanoparticles with two distinguishable size ranges, supporting porosity decrease. These nanoparticles were attributed to pure La0.8−xCexAg0.2MnO3 and the other phases resulting from the interaction of Ce ions. EDX results also indicate that Ce ions have been successfully replaced in La0.8−xCexAg0.2MnO3. Correlation of different results let to conclude that the resulting product can be applied in the future in field of magnetic refrigeration.","meta":{"doi":"803431"},"tokens":[[{"start":18,"end":42,"text":"quaternary nanostructure","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":43,"end":62,"text":"La0.8−xCexAg0.2MnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":63,"end":73,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":106,"end":124,"text":"solid-state method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":129,"end":140,"text":"calcination","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":202,"end":212,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":224,"end":233,"text":"manganite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":239,"end":250,"text":"rare earths","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":255,"end":261,"text":"Alkali","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":317,"end":319,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":340,"end":356,"text":"crystallite size","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":361,"end":372,"text":"microstrain","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":380,"end":397,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":399,"end":402,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":454,"end":482,"text":"Scanning electron microscope","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":517,"end":549,"text":"energy dispersive X-ray analyzer","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":551,"end":554,"text":"EDX","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":584,"end":590,"text":"cerium","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":592,"end":594,"text":"Ce","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":620,"end":635,"text":"Williamson–Hall","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":640,"end":664,"text":"size-strain plot methods","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":706,"end":709,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":714,"end":754,"text":"Rietveld refinement by Fullprof software","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":797,"end":807,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":867,"end":869,"text":"Ce","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":959,"end":961,"text":"Ce","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":981,"end":983,"text":"La","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1114,"end":1116,"text":"Ce","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1117,"end":1135,"text":"ion concentrations","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1157,"end":1175,"text":"surface morphology","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1233,"end":1246,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1321,"end":1334,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1359,"end":1378,"text":"La0.8−xCexAg0.2MnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1434,"end":1436,"text":"Ce","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1443,"end":1446,"text":"EDX","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1474,"end":1476,"text":"Ce","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1517,"end":1536,"text":"La0.8−xCexAg0.2MnO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1655,"end":1677,"text":"magnetic refrigeration","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":532,"created_at":"2022-11-16T10:50:27.142053Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T10:50:27.142053Z","lead_time":301.983}

Experimentally, it is established that the incorporation of MoS2 with 2 mg/ml concentration effectively acts as a barrier to ion migration and minimizes the shunt contact. The optimum absorber thickness, defect density, and optimum MoS2 thickness were theoretically evaluated and discussed by modeling the electrical characteristics of the cells using SCAPS-1D software, hence, the correlation of structural and morphologic tuning can be examined. The optimum absorber thickness of 400 nm and 363 nm was shown for simulation and experimental, respectively, meanwhile, the optimum MoS2 thickness of 30 nm recorded in the simulation was agreed by an experimental thickness of 29 nm. Remarkably, the surface morphology of the perovskite layer with visible pinholes was observed and successfully concealed by the optimum MoS2 concentration. The simulated HTL structure based on the optimized parameters showed an efficiency of 11.24%, and the hybrid-HTL structure showed a significant enhancement in the efficiency by up to 14.16%. Further validation via experiment, the efficiency of 8.3% and 9.5% was obtained for the HTL and hybrid-HTL structures, respectively.

{"text":"Nanocomposites can offer a platform to conjugate biorecognition features of aptamer with unique size-dependent properties of a given material, which can autoprobe the binding event based on their electroactive characteristics. Herein, we design electroactive switchable aptamer probes based on co-doped single-phase semiconducting materials employing the cyclic voltammetry method to record the current signal at each step of electrochemical characterization. To do so, we utilized a facile hydrothermal method assisted by co-precipitation method such as Co-Fe-co-doped Ba0.5Sr0.5Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ (CF-BSZY) and tuned the alignment of the energy band structure of the material to amplify the output of the electrochemical signal. At various steps, changes occurred in the electrochemical properties at the surface of CF-BSZY. The binding of the ssDNA with prepared materials enhances the current signal by the interaction with the target (ochratoxin A (OTA)) depressing the current signal and facilitating the construction of a novel design of electrochemical aptasensor. As a proof of concept, an electrochemical aptasensor for the detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) in rice samples has been developed. The electrochemical aptasensor provides a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.00012 μM (0.12 nM), with a linear range from 0.000247 to 0.74 μM and sound OTA recovery in real samples. The developed aptasensor is simply designed and is free of oligonucleotide labeling or decorative nanoparticle modifications. The proposed mechanism is generic in principle with the potential to translate any type of aptamer and target binding event into a detectable signal; hence, it can be largely applied to various bioreceptor recognition phenomena for subsequent applications.","meta":{"doi":"803428"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":14,"text":"Nanocomposites","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":196,"end":225,"text":"electroactive characteristics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":294,"end":302,"text":"co-doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":316,"end":330,"text":"semiconducting","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":303,"end":315,"text":"single-phase","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":355,"end":380,"text":"cyclic voltammetry method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":491,"end":546,"text":"hydrothermal method assisted by co-precipitation method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":555,"end":560,"text":"Co-Fe","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":561,"end":569,"text":"co-doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":570,"end":593,"text":"Ba0.5Sr0.5Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":595,"end":602,"text":"CF-BSZY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":635,"end":656,"text":"energy band structure","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":768,"end":794,"text":"electrochemical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":813,"end":820,"text":"CF-BSZY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":935,"end":947,"text":"ochratoxin A","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":949,"end":952,"text":"OTA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1142,"end":1154,"text":"ochratoxin A","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1156,"end":1159,"text":"OTA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1094,"end":1120,"text":"electrochemical aptasensor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1201,"end":1227,"text":"electrochemical aptasensor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1344,"end":1347,"text":"OTA","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1388,"end":1398,"text":"aptasensor","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":529,"created_at":"2022-11-16T10:34:46.120543Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T10:34:46.120543Z","lead_time":291.917}

On the one hand, by controlling the content of Sn2+ doping, the energy level of the tin-doped PQDs can be adjusted, to realize optimized band alignment and enhanced separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. On the other hand, the incorporation of tin-doped PQDs provided with a relatively high acceptor concentration due to the self-p-type doping effect is able to reduce the width of the depletion region near the back surface of the perovskite, thereby enhancing the hole extraction.

However, most previously reported synaptic devices exhibit fixed performance once been fabricated, which limits their application in diverse scenarios. Here, we report floating-gate photosensitive synaptic transistors with charge-trapping perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al2O3 tunneling layers, which exhibit typical synaptic behaviors including excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), pair-pulse facilitation and dynamic filtering characteristics under both electrical or optical signal stimulation. Further, the combination of the high-quality Al2O3 tuning layer and highly photosensitive PQDs charge-trapping layer provides the devices with extensively tunable synaptic performance under optical and electrical co-modulation. Applying light during electrical modulation can significantly improve both the synaptic weight changes and the non-linearity of weight updates, while the memory effect under light modulation can be obviously adjusted by the gate voltage. The pattern learning and forgetting processes for “0” and “1” with different synaptic weights and memory times are further demonstrated in the device array. Overall, this work provides synaptic devices with tunable functions for building complex and robust artificial neural networks.","meta":{"doi":"803415"},"tokens":[[{"start":481,"end":486,"text":"Al2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":497,"end":503,"text":"layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":346,"end":395,"text":"floating-gate photosensitive synaptic transistors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":756,"end":761,"text":"Al2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":762,"end":774,"text":"tuning layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":806,"end":827,"text":"charge-trapping layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1163,"end":1175,"text":"gate voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":417,"end":440,"text":"perovskite quantum dots","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":442,"end":446,"text":"PQDs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":801,"end":805,"text":"PQDs","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":516,"created_at":"2022-11-16T09:46:04.233706Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T10:28:43.167191Z","lead_time":2595.84}

Controllable doping is an effective strategy to regulate the optical properties of Cs2SnX6. Herein, combining the first principles calculation and spectral analysis, we attempted to understand the luminescence mechanism of Te4+-doped Cs2SnCl6 lead-free perovskite variants. The chemical potential and defect formation energy are calculated to confirm theoretically the feasible substitutability of tetravalent Te4+ ions in Cs2SnCl6 lattices for the Sn-site. Through analysis of the absorption, emission/excitation, and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, the intense green-yellow emission in Te4+:Cs2SnCl6 was considered to originate from the triplet Te(IV) ion 3P1→1S0 STE recombination. Temperature-dependent PL spectra demonstrated the strong electron-phonon coupling that inducing an evident lattice distortion to produce STEs. We further calculated the electronic band structure and molecular orbital levels to reveal the underlying photophysical process.

{"text":"The aim of this study was to evaluate a perovskite catalyst for use as a carbon-resistant catalyst in methane dry reforming. The oxygen-rich ABO3+δ (CeCoxNi1-xO3+δ) perovskite was selected for this investigation due to its crystalline nature and ability to accommodate a wide range of cations; perovskites notably possess catalytically advantageous oxidation and reduction properties. The perovskite catalysts were prepared as multicomponent oxides by sol-gel synthesis, which is considered a most effective technique for preparing these compounds. The properties of fresh catalysts were evaluated through X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis, particle size distribution analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The tested catalysts exhibited superior catalytic performance over previously-studied ABO3 catalysts, such as LaCoO3 and LaNiO3 systems. This high performance is attributed to electronic interactions between the Co and Ni sites, which results from the atomic-level mixing of ingredients in the sol-gel method. Analysis results revealed that when used as a catalyst in methane dry reforming, the presence of ceria in the perovskite system can improve coking resilience and confer stability even under prolonged usage in a carbon-rich environment.","meta":{"doi":"803420"},"tokens":[[{"start":40,"end":50,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":51,"end":59,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":73,"end":98,"text":"carbon-resistant catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":102,"end":123,"text":"methane dry reforming","annotation":"APL"},{"start":149,"end":163,"text":"CeCoxNi1-xO3+δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":165,"end":175,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":223,"end":241,"text":"crystalline nature","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":294,"end":305,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":389,"end":399,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":400,"end":409,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":452,"end":469,"text":"sol-gel synthesis","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":573,"end":582,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":606,"end":623,"text":"X-ray diffraction","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":625,"end":669,"text":"Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":671,"end":706,"text":"particle size distribution analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":708,"end":740,"text":"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":746,"end":774,"text":"scanning electron microscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":787,"end":796,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":816,"end":837,"text":"catalytic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":867,"end":876,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":886,"end":892,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":897,"end":903,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":988,"end":990,"text":"Co","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":995,"end":997,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1070,"end":1084,"text":"sol-gel method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":1132,"end":1140,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1144,"end":1165,"text":"methane dry reforming","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1196,"end":1206,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1255,"end":1264,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1226,"end":1243,"text":"coking resilience","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":521,"created_at":"2022-11-16T10:00:57.175886Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T10:00:57.175886Z","lead_time":220.824}

{"text":"Due to being an economic alternative to various oxides and even noble metals in many catalytic applications, perovskites are getting interest day by day by the researchers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the synergistic effect of metal species co-substitution in perovskite type catalysts in different biomass types pyrolysis process. Thus, evaluating the feedstocks and pyrolysis products in terms of yields, quality and potential use is successfully achieved. Perovskite-type catalysts LaCo0.5Mn0.5O3, LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 and LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3 were prepared by sol–gel method, characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption, XRD and SEM techniques, and performed in the catalytic pyrolysis of two biomass samples (date seed and mandarin peel) in a tubular reactor at 520 °C with 100 °C/min and 100 cm3/min N2 atmosphere. Partial substitution of Bʹ was found to favor the catalytic activity as compared to non-catalytic results. The best pyrolysis performance was obtained with LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3, achieving maximum bio-oil yield of 28.33 and 25.73% for date seed and mandarin peel, respectively. Moreover, the best performance of LaMn0.5Ni0.5O3 signifies the best synergistic effect between Ni and Mn. The bio-oil characterization including elemental analysis, 1H-NMR, FT-IR, and GC–MS results showed that catalysts favored to increase the H content and decrease the O content.

{"text":"Pyridine molecules have been widely used to improve the performances of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the effects of pyridine molecular structure, especially the functional group, on the defects passivation of perovskite solar cell have a lack of investigation. In this work, we introduced three pyridine molecules as additives into perovskite layer, including pyridine (PY), 4-methyl-pyridine (MP) and 4-tertbutyl pyridine (TBP), to investigate the influences of the molecular structure on the surface-defect passivation and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells. In fact, the pyridine molecules play two roles in the perovskite films. On the one hand, due to the different molecular structure, these pyridine molecules present differences in electron-pair-donor abilities (TBP > MP > PY), and then affect the interaction of pyridine molecule with Pb2+ in perovskite. Importantly, with the increase of interaction between different functional groups and Pb2+, the defect passivation effect was enhanced. What’s more, the crystal quality and light harvesting ability of the corresponding perovskite layer are improved by large crystal size and slow growth process. Consequently, PSCs with TBP, MP and PY respectively obtained a power conversion efficiency of 17.03%, 15.49% and 14.34%, which are higher than that of without additive (13.34%). On the other hand, owing to the hydrophobicity of groups, the pyridine molecules can enhance the moisture stability of devices. Significantly, the device based on the TBP-modified perovskite film exhibited improved moisture stability among the four type devices, owing to the best characteristic of the tertiary-butyl group with hydrophobicity in TBP.","meta":{"doi":"803416"},"tokens":[[{"start":72,"end":94,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":96,"end":100,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":0,"end":18,"text":"Pyridine molecules","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":127,"end":145,"text":"pyridine molecular","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":172,"end":188,"text":"functional group","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":197,"end":216,"text":"defects passivation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":220,"end":241,"text":"perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":306,"end":324,"text":"pyridine molecules","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":343,"end":353,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":354,"end":359,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":371,"end":379,"text":"pyridine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":381,"end":383,"text":"PY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":386,"end":403,"text":"4-methyl-pyridine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":405,"end":407,"text":"MP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":413,"end":433,"text":"4-tertbutyl pyridine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":435,"end":438,"text":"TBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":505,"end":531,"text":"surface-defect passivation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":546,"end":555,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":559,"end":581,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":637,"end":647,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":648,"end":653,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":793,"end":796,"text":"TBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":799,"end":801,"text":"MP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":804,"end":806,"text":"PY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":867,"end":871,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":762,"end":791,"text":"electron-pair-donor abilities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":844,"end":861,"text":"pyridine molecule","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":875,"end":885,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":951,"end":968,"text":"functional groups","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":973,"end":977,"text":"Pb2+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":983,"end":1008,"text":"defect passivation effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1040,"end":1055,"text":"crystal quality","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1060,"end":1084,"text":"light harvesting ability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1106,"end":1116,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1117,"end":1122,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1197,"end":1201,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1207,"end":1210,"text":"TBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1212,"end":1214,"text":"MP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1219,"end":1221,"text":"PY","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1246,"end":1273,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1393,"end":1407,"text":"hydrophobicity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1423,"end":1441,"text":"pyridine molecules","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1458,"end":1476,"text":"moisture stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1528,"end":1531,"text":"TBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1541,"end":1551,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1552,"end":1556,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1576,"end":1594,"text":"moisture stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1708,"end":1711,"text":"TBP","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1690,"end":1704,"text":"hydrophobicity","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":517,"created_at":"2022-11-16T09:50:32.443779Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T09:50:32.443779Z","lead_time":266.647}

The presences of Ca, Cu, Ti and O in the synthesized photocatalysts are confirmed with Elemental X-ray Dispersive (EDX) analysis. The cubic phases in the polyhedral shape of the materials are detected in X-ray diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).

The precursors PbI2 and CsI were solved in aqueous solution and heated to form the CsPbI3 perovskite.

{"text":"In this study, an inorganic salt hydrazinium iodide (HAI) was introduced as an additive in the precursor solution to improve the intrinsic photostability of light absorber layer made of complex lead halide perovskite MAPbI3. Further, the effects of HAI addition on the photostability of MAPbI3 thin films, device performance and operational stability of solar cells were explored. Our findings show that the addition of HAI into MAPbI3 precursor increases the crystallinity of film, promotes the grain size with homogeneous film morphology and results in the intermediate formation. In turn, this improves the charge carrier recombination dynamics and quality of perovskite film, overall enhancing the photostability of the thin-film samples upon light exposure up to 1200 h. Furthermore, the addition of an optimal amount of HAI content shows improved power conversion efficiency of 17.03% and operational stability of ~80% (of the initial stage) after 4400 h of continuous illumination in an inert environment.Graphic abstract","meta":{"doi":"803406"},"tokens":[[{"start":33,"end":51,"text":"hydrazinium iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":53,"end":56,"text":"HAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":139,"end":153,"text":"photostability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":157,"end":177,"text":"light absorber layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":217,"end":223,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":186,"end":216,"text":"complex lead halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":269,"end":283,"text":"photostability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":287,"end":293,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":294,"end":304,"text":"thin films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":329,"end":350,"text":"operational stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":354,"end":365,"text":"solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":420,"end":423,"text":"HAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":429,"end":435,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":460,"end":473,"text":"crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":477,"end":481,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":496,"end":506,"text":"grain size","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":702,"end":716,"text":"photostability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":663,"end":673,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":674,"end":678,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":724,"end":733,"text":"thin-film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":826,"end":829,"text":"HAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":853,"end":880,"text":"power conversion efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":826,"end":827,"text":"H","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":895,"end":916,"text":"operational stability","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":610,"end":647,"text":"charge carrier recombination dynamics","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":483,"created_at":"2022-11-15T07:51:46.535419Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T07:51:46.535419Z","lead_time":208.712}
{"text":"In this paper, we present the synthesis and studies of physical properties of the ferroelectromagnetic composites (1–x)PbMn1/3Ta2/3O3–xPbTiO3 [(1–x)PMnT–xPT], which exhibit a relaxor behavior. Using a synergistic application of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray structure analysis, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), we revealed that two phases always coexist in the synthesis of the composition PbMn1/3Ta2/3O3 (PMnT), one phase of which has a pyrochlore structure, and the other has a pseudo-cubic cell of the perovskite structure. We further demonstrated that doping with lead titanate PbTiO3 (PT) suppresses the dielectric polarization’s relaxor behavior. Using X-ray diffraction techniques at room temperature, we studied the dependencies of the structural parameters of each phase on the mole fractions of PT. The dielectric characteristics were studied at various frequencies by the dielectric spectroscopy method, and the dependency of the bandgap Eg on the dopant’s mole fractions was determined by the optical absorption method. The dopant’s influence on the IR Fourier spectra and magnetic hysteresis loops was analyzed. The magnetodielectric and magnetoresistive effects in these composites were studied.","meta":{"doi":"803405"},"tokens":[[{"start":55,"end":74,"text":"physical properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":82,"end":102,"text":"ferroelectromagnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":103,"end":113,"text":"composites","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":175,"end":191,"text":"relaxor behavior","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":228,"end":256,"text":"scanning electron microscopy","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":258,"end":261,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":264,"end":288,"text":"X-ray structure analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":294,"end":326,"text":"energy-dispersive X-ray analysis","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":328,"end":331,"text":"EDX","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":413,"end":427,"text":"PbMn1/3Ta2/3O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":429,"end":433,"text":"PMnT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":143,"end":156,"text":"(1–x)PMnT–xPT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":114,"end":141,"text":"(1–x)PbMn1/3Ta2/3O3–xPbTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":461,"end":471,"text":"pyrochlore","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":503,"end":515,"text":"pseudo-cubic","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":528,"end":538,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":591,"end":604,"text":"lead titanate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":605,"end":611,"text":"PbTiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":613,"end":615,"text":"PT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":632,"end":674,"text":"dielectric polarization’s relaxor behavior","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":682,"end":710,"text":"X-ray diffraction techniques","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":828,"end":830,"text":"PT","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":836,"end":862,"text":"dielectric characteristics","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":906,"end":936,"text":"dielectric spectroscopy method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":964,"end":971,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1028,"end":1053,"text":"optical absorption method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1085,"end":1103,"text":"IR Fourier spectra","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1152,"end":1169,"text":"magnetodielectric","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1174,"end":1198,"text":"magnetoresistive effects","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":482,"created_at":"2022-11-15T07:48:16.883421Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T07:48:16.883421Z","lead_time":247.953}

{"text":"The continued scaling of silicon-based electronics is quickly approaching its fundamental material limit, which has motivated worldwide efforts in exploring new electronic materials and unconventional device architectures. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals, halide perovskites, and self-assembled molecular monolayers represent prominent examples of emerging electronic materials with significant promise for the continued miniaturization or function diversification. However, probing the fundamental transport properties and capturing the intrinsic merits of these emerging electronic materials are not always straightforward because they are usually delicate and prone to degradation during the conventional material integration and device fabrication steps. To this end, an alternative bond-free integration strategy, in which the pre-synthesized/fabricated material components are physically transferred and assembled together through weak van der Waals (vdW) force, offers a mild process for seamlessly combining highly disparate materials to form artificial heterostructures with atomically clean and electronically sharp interfaces, enabling the creation of high-performance devices for probing and pushing the limit of the emerging electronic materials. In this article, we summarize the efforts in our laboratory over the past 12 years, in developing, optimizing, and expanding the vdW integration strategy for creating and investigating high-performance devices from 2D atomic crystals, soft lattice halide perovskites, and self-assembled molecular monolayers. We also discuss how flexible vdW integration may enable a new generation of artificial materials, including vdW superlattices, vdW thin films or 3D frameworks.

The average crystallite size (Dhkl) of SNMWO was found to be about 22 nm, which was calculated using Scherrer relation. The analysis of the data of dielectric, impedance and electrical conduction for a wide range of frequency and temperature of SNMWO provides interesting characteristics for useful applications. The dielectric relaxation and electrical properties are related to the grains, grain boundaries and electrode characteristics of SNMOW.

{"text":"The optoelectronic performances of the layered materials are strongly dependent on the thickness of the samples due to the surface effect. As the size of the samples decreases to few nanometers, the surface depletion field and surface defect density are prominent arising from the large surface to volume ratio. For instance, thin two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite microplates usually exhibit a rather low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), owning to the strong surface effect. Here, we report that the PLQY can be enhanced as large as 28 times in (iso-BA)2Pbl4 (BA = C4H9NH3) 2D perovskite thin microplates encapsulated by graphene, resulting in that the PLQY is more than 18% for the microplate with a thickness of 6.7 nm at 78 K. As the thickness of the 2D perovskite microplate increases, the enhancement is gradually reduced and finally vanishes. This observation is in striking contrast to that in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), when the PLQY is quenched by covering a layer of graphene due to the efficient charge transfer. The enhancement of PLQY in 2D perovskites can be mainly ascribed to the reduced quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) due to the reduced surface depletion field after covering graphene flake, resulting in the enhanced radiative recombination efficiency. Our findings provide a cost-effective approach to enhance the luminescence, which may pave the way toward high performance light emitting devices based on 2D perovskites.","meta":{"doi":"803396"},"tokens":[[{"start":4,"end":31,"text":"optoelectronic performances","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":39,"end":46,"text":"layered","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":123,"end":137,"text":"surface effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":199,"end":222,"text":"surface depletion field","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":227,"end":249,"text":"surface defect density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":326,"end":330,"text":"thin","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":331,"end":346,"text":"two-dimensional","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":348,"end":350,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":377,"end":387,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":388,"end":399,"text":"microplates","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":429,"end":460,"text":"photoluminescence quantum yield","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":462,"end":466,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":490,"end":504,"text":"surface effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":531,"end":535,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":576,"end":604,"text":"(iso-BA)2Pbl4 (BA = C4H9NH3)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":608,"end":618,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":605,"end":607,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":619,"end":635,"text":"thin microplates","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":652,"end":660,"text":"graphene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":684,"end":688,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":714,"end":724,"text":"microplate","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":785,"end":787,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":788,"end":798,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":799,"end":809,"text":"microplate","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":942,"end":974,"text":"transition metal dichalcogenides","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":976,"end":980,"text":"TMDs","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":932,"end":941,"text":"monolayer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":992,"end":996,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1032,"end":1040,"text":"graphene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1023,"end":1028,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1098,"end":1102,"text":"PLQY","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1106,"end":1108,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1109,"end":1120,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1159,"end":1188,"text":"quantum confined Stark effect","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1190,"end":1194,"text":"QCSE","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1215,"end":1238,"text":"surface depletion field","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1254,"end":1262,"text":"graphene","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1296,"end":1330,"text":"radiative recombination efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1394,"end":1406,"text":"luminescence","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1487,"end":1489,"text":"2D","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1490,"end":1501,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1455,"end":1477,"text":"light emitting devices","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":473,"created_at":"2022-11-15T07:16:05.804666Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T07:16:16.590999Z","lead_time":249.052}

{"text":"Metal halide perovskites, as a new generation of optoelectronic materials, have attracted a great deal of interest due to their remarkable intrinsic properties. Due to the excellent optoelectronic properties, the perovskite crystals are widely used in lasers, photodetectors, X-ray detectors and solar cells. Considering the device performance and fabrication requirements, proper thickness of the crystal is required to avoid carrier loss and simultaneously ensure sufficient light absorption, which can realize the full potential of its excellent carrier transport property. Thus, the fabrication of perovskite crystal in a thin film with an adjustable thickness is highly desirable. The space-confined method has been demonstrated to be an effective way of preparing perovskite with controlled thickness. In this method, the thickness of perovskite can be regulated flexibly in a geometric confined space. Moreover, the size, quality and architecture of perovskite crystal films are also major concerns for practical photoelectric devices, which can also be optimized by the space-confined method owing to its good adaptability towards various modified strategies. In a word, the space-confined method is not only a simple and conventional way to adjust the thickness of perovskite crystal films, but also provides a platform to optimize their size, quality and architecture through applying appropriate strategies to the confined space. Herein, we review the space-confined growth of perovskite crystal films. Particularly, various modified strategies based on the space-confined method applied to the optimization of thickness, size, quality and architecture are highlighted. Then the stability investigating and component regulating of perovskite crystal films would be also mentioned. Furthermore, the correlation between the perovskite thickness and the device performance is discussed.

Our study shows that Cs3Bi2Br9 is a promising candidate for X-ray detection applications.","meta":{"doi":"803391"},"tokens":[[{"start":14,"end":42,"text":"lead-free halide perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":99,"end":118,"text":"thermal stabilities","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":130,"end":155,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":201,"end":232,"text":"bismuth-based halide perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":233,"end":242,"text":"Cs3Bi2Br9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":334,"end":358,"text":"modified Bridgman method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":443,"end":452,"text":"Cs3Bi2Br9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":432,"end":442,"text":"crack-free","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":515,"end":531,"text":"carrier mobility","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":618,"end":630,"text":"trap density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":659,"end":668,"text":"Cs3Bi2Br9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":717,"end":732,"text":"X-ray detection","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":751,"end":773,"text":"absorption coefficient","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":786,"end":803,"text":"X-ray sensitivity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":861,"end":881,"text":"dark current density","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":986,"end":1001,"text":"X-ray detectors","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1024,"end":1033,"text":"Cs3Bi2Br9","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1063,"end":1091,"text":"X-ray detection applications","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":468,"created_at":"2022-11-15T06:58:37.507335Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T06:58:37.507335Z","lead_time":151.424}
{"text":"A series of Ni–La–O-T catalysts (T-calcination temperature) were prepared via the sol–gel process followed by the calcination. They were tested for in situ aqueous phase hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of methyl palmitate using methanol as hydrogen donor. In the calcined samples, NiO and La2O2(CO3) formed in Ni–La–O-550 and Ni–La–O-650. Apart from NiO and La2O2(CO3), there was LaNiO3 perovskite in Ni–La–O-750. Only LaNiO3 perovskite existed in Ni–La–O-800. After the reduction at 650 °C, metallic Ni and La2O3 appeared in all the catalysts. During in situ HDO, decarbonylation/decarboxylation was dominating, accompanying with the C–C bond hydrogenolysis and aqueous phase reforming of alkanes. H2 was generated from not only the aqueous phase reforming of methanol but also that of alkanes. Liquid C6–C16 alkanes were produced and C15 alkane was main product. Among the catalysts, Ni–La–O-750 afforded the highest activity for deoxygenation, C–C bond hydrogenolysis and aqueous phase reforming. The reaction temperature, reaction time, water and methanol loadings remarkably affected the products distribution. At a suitable condition, the yield of C6–C16 alkanes reached 71.1% on Ni–La–O-750. Additionally, Ni–La–O-750 was also very active for in situ HDO of methyl palmitate without methanol, however, the C–C bond hydrogenolysis was more serious.","meta":{"doi":"803390"},"tokens":[[{"start":12,"end":21,"text":"Ni–La–O-T","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":22,"end":31,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":82,"end":97,"text":"sol–gel process","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":35,"end":58,"text":"calcination temperature","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":114,"end":125,"text":"calcination","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":151,"end":188,"text":"situ aqueous phase hydrodeoxygenation","annotation":"APL"},{"start":190,"end":193,"text":"HDO","annotation":"APL"},{"start":198,"end":214,"text":"methyl palmitate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":221,"end":229,"text":"methanol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":233,"end":241,"text":"hydrogen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":274,"end":277,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":282,"end":292,"text":"La2O2(CO3)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":303,"end":314,"text":"Ni–La–O-550","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":319,"end":330,"text":"Ni–La–O-650","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":343,"end":346,"text":"NiO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":351,"end":361,"text":"La2O2(CO3)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":373,"end":379,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":380,"end":390,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":394,"end":405,"text":"Ni–La–O-750","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":412,"end":418,"text":"LaNiO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":419,"end":429,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":441,"end":452,"text":"Ni–La–O-800","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":494,"end":496,"text":"Ni","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":501,"end":506,"text":"La2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":527,"end":536,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":553,"end":556,"text":"HDO","annotation":"APL"},{"start":692,"end":694,"text":"H2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":796,"end":802,"text":"C6–C16","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":829,"end":832,"text":"C15","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":868,"end":877,"text":"catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":879,"end":890,"text":"Ni–La–O-750","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1044,"end":1052,"text":"methanol","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1147,"end":1153,"text":"C6–C16","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1179,"end":1190,"text":"Ni–La–O-750","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1206,"end":1217,"text":"Ni–La–O-750","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1251,"end":1254,"text":"HDO","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1258,"end":1274,"text":"methyl palmitate","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1283,"end":1291,"text":"methanol","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":467,"created_at":"2022-11-15T06:56:04.389953Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T06:56:04.389953Z","lead_time":14007.075}
{"text":"This paper proposes a novel design of plasmonic perovskite solar cell (PSC). It consists of an anti-reflective glass of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), a compact buffer layer of n-type titanium dioxide (TiO2), an absorbing thin-film layer of perovskite (MAPbI3) integrated with gold (Au) nanospheres, a layer of p-type doped spiro-OMeTAD, and a layer of the cathode on aluminum (Al). This multilayer design’s primary purpose is to allow the light to enter the PSC with the minimum reflection and trap it in the active layer due to the presence of Au nanospheres. In this layer, the higher efficiency of PSC is achieved by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) in the wavelength range from 300 to 1100 nm. A reflective Al layer is used at the bottom of the device to reflect the light into the upper layers to considerably enhance the PSC absorption. The three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method was conducted to find the best solution to Maxwell’s equations so that the best thickness and radius can be selected for each layer and Au nanospheres, respectively. Proper physical dimensions and Au nanospheres played a significant role in numerically indicating that the proposed structures are 60% more absorbent than the other conventional PSCs. In-house simulation software is used to approximate the solar cell by applying the finite element method to develop solutions for the drift–diffusion and Poisson’s equations. The examinations of the previous studies revealed that the current study is the first study that has simulated the real model of Auger recombination in perovskite. The results indicated that the proposed PSC embedded with Au nanospheres has the following properties: the built-in potential of 3.16 V, short-circuit current of 27.97 mA/cm2, the open-circuit voltage of 1 V, maximum power of 24.84 mW/cm2, fill-factor of 0.88, the conduction band of 3 eV, electron quasi-Fermi level of 2.5 eV, the hole quasi-Fermi level of 0.6 eV, and efficiency of 24.84%. Finally, the suggested PSC has performed 62% more efficient than conventional PSCs.","meta":{"doi":"803389"},"tokens":[[{"start":38,"end":69,"text":"plasmonic perovskite solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":71,"end":74,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":120,"end":144,"text":"fluorine-doped tin oxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":146,"end":149,"text":"FTO","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":95,"end":116,"text":"anti-reflective glass","annotation":"APL"},{"start":154,"end":174,"text":"compact buffer layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":178,"end":184,"text":"n-type","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":185,"end":201,"text":"titanium dioxide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":203,"end":207,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":213,"end":238,"text":"absorbing thin-film layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":242,"end":252,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":254,"end":260,"text":"MAPbI3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":278,"end":282,"text":"gold","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":284,"end":286,"text":"Au","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":288,"end":299,"text":"nanospheres","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":303,"end":309,"text":"layer ","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":319,"end":324,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":312,"end":318,"text":"p-type","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":325,"end":337,"text":"spiro-OMeTAD","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":345,"end":350,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":358,"end":365,"text":"cathode","annotation":"APL"},{"start":369,"end":378,"text":"aluminum ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":379,"end":381,"text":"Al","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":460,"end":463,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":511,"end":523,"text":"active layer","annotation":"APL"},{"start":547,"end":549,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":550,"end":561,"text":"nanospheres","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":589,"end":599,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":603,"end":606,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":622,"end":658,"text":"localized surface plasmon resonances","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":660,"end":665,"text":"LSPRs","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":725,"end":727,"text":"Al","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":728,"end":733,"text":"layer","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":806,"end":812,"text":"layers","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":841,"end":844,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":861,"end":915,"text":"three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1052,"end":1054,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1055,"end":1066,"text":"nanospheres","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1089,"end":1108,"text":"physical dimensions","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1113,"end":1115,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1116,"end":1127,"text":"nanospheres","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1260,"end":1264,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1266,"end":1294,"text":"In-house simulation software","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1322,"end":1332,"text":"solar cell","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1349,"end":1370,"text":"finite element method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1570,"end":1589,"text":"Auger recombination","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1593,"end":1603,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1645,"end":1648,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1663,"end":1665,"text":"Au","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1666,"end":1677,"text":"nanospheres","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1712,"end":1730,"text":"built-in potential","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1742,"end":1763,"text":"short-circuit current","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1785,"end":1805,"text":"open-circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1845,"end":1856,"text":"fill-factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1814,"end":1827,"text":"maximum power","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1870,"end":1885,"text":"conduction band","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1895,"end":1921,"text":"electron quasi-Fermi level","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1937,"end":1959,"text":"hole quasi-Fermi level","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1975,"end":1985,"text":"efficiency","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":2020,"end":2023,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":2075,"end":2079,"text":"PSCs","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":466,"created_at":"2022-11-15T03:02:36.278535Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T03:02:36.278535Z","lead_time":543.666}
{"text":"LiCl-KCl molten salt has been used as a reaction medium to synthesize various perovskite materials from oxide precursors. However, it was observed that temperature, p(O2), precursor mix ratio, etc., greatly affected the perovskite stoichiometry, phase stability, crystal structure, and the formation of various impurities (secondary phases). Thermodynamics and kinetics involved in the synthesis are complicated. Guidance from thermodynamic modeling is thus needed to control the formation of the perovskites. In the present work, for the first time we use the CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) approach to develop a perovskite-molten salt thermodynamic database, which is used to understand the phase equilibrium between the molten salt, precursor oxides, and the resulting LaMnO3 (LMO) perovskite. Especially, the effects of temperature, La2O3 and Mn2O3 precursor ratio, and p(O2) on the LMO phase stability were predicted. Pseudo-ternary isothermal sections were generated, which successfully predicted the coexistence of LaMnO3 and the impurity, LaOCl. Meanwhile, the molten salt thermodynamic experiments were designed and carried out to verify La and Mn's solubilities in LiCl-KCl molten salt and thermodynamic equilibria in the La-Mn-O-Li-K-Cl system.

{"text":"Halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention as semiconducting materials for various optoelectronic applications. The functional metal-halide octahedral units and their spatial arrangements play a key role in the optoelectronic properties of these materials. At present, most of the efforts for material exploration focus on substituting the constituent elements of functional octahedral units, whereas designing the spatial arrangement of the functional units has received relatively little consideration. In this work, via a global structure search based on density functional theory (DFT), we discovered a metastable three-dimensional honeycomb-like perovskite structure with the functional octahedral units arranged through mixed edge- and corner-sharing. We experimentally confirmed that the honeycomb-like perovskite structure can be stabilized by divalent molecular cations with suitable size and shape, such as 2,2′-bisimidazole (BIM). DFT calculations and experimental characterizations revealed that the honeycomb-like perovskite with the formula of BIMPb2I6, synthesized through a solution process, exhibits high electronic dimensionality, a direct allowed bandgap of 2.1 eV, small effective masses for both electrons and holes, and high optical absorption coefficients, which indicates a significant potential for optoelectronic applications. The employed combination of DFT and experimental study provides an exemplary approach to explore prospective optoelectronic semiconductors via spatially arranging functional units.","meta":{"doi":"8"},"tokens":[[{"start":7,"end":18,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":152,"end":162,"text":"octahedral","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":387,"end":397,"text":"octahedral","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":597,"end":600,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":570,"end":595,"text":"density functional theory","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":630,"end":662,"text":"three-dimensional honeycomb-like","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":663,"end":673,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":807,"end":821,"text":"honeycomb-like","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":822,"end":832,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":929,"end":946,"text":"2,2′-bisimidazole","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":948,"end":951,"text":"BIM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":954,"end":957,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1024,"end":1038,"text":"honeycomb-like","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1039,"end":1049,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1393,"end":1396,"text":"DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":223,"end":248,"text":"optoelectronic properties","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":864,"end":890,"text":"divalent molecular cations","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1070,"end":1078,"text":"BIMPb2I6","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1178,"end":1185,"text":"bandgap","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1229,"end":1238,"text":"electrons","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1243,"end":1248,"text":"holes","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":8,"created_at":"2022-11-19T17:11:45.127891Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T17:11:45.127891Z","lead_time":4783.69}

The perovskite-type BSCF mixed-conducting membrane reactor also exhibited good stability for the catalytic OCM membrane reaction during 30-hour preliminary operation.","meta":{"doi":"7"},"tokens":[[{"start":77,"end":166,"text":"densely perovskite-type Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) mixed-conducting membrane reactor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":22,"end":35,"text":"methane (OCM)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":41,"end":50,"text":"SrO/La2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":392,"end":395,"text":"OCM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":221,"end":262,"text":"perovskite-type BSCF functional membranes","annotation":"APL"},{"start":339,"end":342,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":458,"end":513,"text":"oxygen-permeable BSCF mixed-conducting membrane reactor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":425,"end":428,"text":" C2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":531,"end":533,"text":"C2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":569,"end":603,"text":"oxygen-separation membrane reactor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":619,"end":673,"text":"perovskite-type BSCF mixed-conducting membrane reactor","annotation":"APL"},{"start":722,"end":725,"text":"OCM","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":694,"end":703,"text":"stability","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":7,"created_at":"2022-11-15T12:31:01.978405Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T12:31:01.978405Z","lead_time":316.371}

{"text":"The establishment of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in terms of their power-conversion efficiency (PCE) over silicon-based solar cells is undeniable. The state-of-art of easy device fabrications of PSCs has enabled them to rapidly gain a place in third-generation photovoltaic technology. Numerous obstacles remain to be addressed in device efficiency and stability. Low performance owing to easily degraded surface and deterioration of perovskite film quality resulting from humidity are issues that often arise. This work explored a new approach to producing high-quality perovskite films prepared under high relative humidity (RH = 40%–50%). In particular, the ubiquitous 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBp) was introduced into lead iodide (PbI2) precursor as an additive, and the films were fabricated using a two-step deposition method followed by a delay-deposition technique of methylammonium iodide (MAI). High crystallinity and controlled nucleation of MAI were needed, and this approach revealed the significance of time control to ensure high-quality films with large grain size, high crystallography, wide coverage on substrate, and precise and evenly coupled MAI molecules to PbI2 films. Compared with the two-step method without time delay, a noticeable improvement in PCE from 3.2 to 8.3% was achieved for the sample prepared with 15 s time delay. This finding was primarily due to the significant enhancement in the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor of the device. This strategy can effectively improve the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films, as well as reduce the recombination of photogenerated carriers and increase of current density of devices, thereby achieving improved photovoltaic performance.","meta":{"doi":"119361"},"tokens":[[{"start":20,"end":44,"text":" perovskite solar cells ","annotation":"APL"},{"start":69,"end":102,"text":"power-conversion efficiency (PCE)","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":108,"end":133,"text":"silicon-based solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":197,"end":200,"text":"PSC","annotation":"APL"},{"start":263,"end":286,"text":"photovoltaic technology","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":398,"end":406,"text":"degraded","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":436,"end":446,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":446,"end":451,"text":" film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":475,"end":483,"text":"humidity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":584,"end":588,"text":"film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":572,"end":583,"text":" perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":618,"end":627,"text":" humidity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":674,"end":694,"text":"4-tert-butylpyridine","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":721,"end":732,"text":"lead iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":774,"end":779,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":803,"end":830,"text":" two-step deposition method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":909,"end":922,"text":"crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":938,"end":948,"text":"nucleation","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":952,"end":956,"text":"MAI ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":845,"end":872,"text":"delay-deposition technique ","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":875,"end":896,"text":"methylammonium iodide","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":897,"end":902,"text":"(MAI)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1068,"end":1079,"text":" grain size","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1086,"end":1101,"text":"crystallography","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1108,"end":1129,"text":"coverage on substrate","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1161,"end":1165,"text":" MAI","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1179,"end":1183,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1184,"end":1189,"text":"films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1209,"end":1224,"text":"two-step method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":734,"end":738,"text":"PbI2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":696,"end":699,"text":"tBp","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1422,"end":1442,"text":"open-circuit voltage","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1444,"end":1465,"text":"short-circuit current","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1470,"end":1482,"text":" fill factor","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1539,"end":1550,"text":" morphology","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1555,"end":1568,"text":"crystallinity","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1572,"end":1582,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1582,"end":1588,"text":" films","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1629,"end":1652,"text":"photogenerated carriers","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1724,"end":1748,"text":"photovoltaic performance","annotation":"PRO"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":13,"created_at":"2022-11-22T11:39:03.907956Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T11:39:03.907956Z","lead_time":516.008}
{"text":"Examination of magnetic perovskite oxides ATO3 containing 3d-transition-metals has led to novel and functional compounds for many applications. Here, in this paper, we present detailed computations based on first-principles density functional theory (DFT) of the crystal, thermodynamic, magnetic and electronic structures of SrTO3 (T = V, Cr, Mn, Co). Full potential linear muffin-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method through the Perdew-Wang generalized gradient approximation (PW91-GGA) has been utilized in all computations. In addition, the effects of exchange-correlation energy (U) and spin-orbit (SO) coupling on magnetic and electronic structures have been investigated via (GGA+SO), (GGA+U) and (GGA+SO+U) methods. The computational results of crystal and thermodynamic structures revealed that all SrTO3 stabilize in a cubic symmetry with (a ≈ 3.80 Å; space group Pm-3m). Besides, SrTO3 compounds show ferromagnetic (FM) and metallic features, which transform to FM and half-metallic (HM) when U energy and SO coupling are included with GGA, except for (T = Co) that remains in its FM metallic nature. These parameters enhance the total density of states (DOS), partial DOSs and magnetic moments, and all obtained DFT results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Thus, the exciting HM–FM nature and stable crystal structures make SrTO3 as effective, promising and candidate material for modern spintronic applications.","meta":{"doi":"119360"},"tokens":[[{"start":15,"end":41,"text":"magnetic perovskite oxides","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":42,"end":46,"text":"ATO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":58,"end":60,"text":"3d","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":61,"end":78,"text":"transition-metals","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":207,"end":255,"text":"first-principles density functional theory (DFT)","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":263,"end":270,"text":"crystal","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":272,"end":285,"text":"thermodynamic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":287,"end":295,"text":"magnetic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":299,"end":321,"text":" electronic structures","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":324,"end":350,"text":" SrTO3 (T = V, Cr, Mn, Co)","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":352,"end":409,"text":"Full potential linear muffin-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":422,"end":479,"text":"Perdew-Wang generalized gradient approximation (PW91-GGA)","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":547,"end":579,"text":"exchange-correlation energy (U) ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":582,"end":607,"text":" spin-orbit (SO) coupling","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":672,"end":681,"text":" (GGA+SO)","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":684,"end":689,"text":"GGA+U","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":696,"end":704,"text":"GGA+SO+U","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":744,"end":752,"text":"crystal ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":756,"end":780,"text":"thermodynamic structures","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":799,"end":804,"text":"SrTO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":882,"end":887,"text":"SrTO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":820,"end":834,"text":"cubic symmetry","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":903,"end":917,"text":"ferromagnetic ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":926,"end":934,"text":"metallic","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":964,"end":966,"text":"FM","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":971,"end":989,"text":"half-metallic (HM)","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":995,"end":1003,"text":"U energy","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1008,"end":1019,"text":"SO coupling","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1038,"end":1041,"text":"GGA","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1083,"end":1095,"text":"FM metallic ","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1138,"end":1161,"text":"density of states (DOS)","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1170,"end":1174,"text":" DOS","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1180,"end":1196,"text":"magnetic moments","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1214,"end":1218,"text":" DFT","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":1300,"end":1306,"text":" HM–FM","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1348,"end":1354,"text":" SrTO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1413,"end":1436,"text":"spintronic applications","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":12,"created_at":"2022-11-22T11:30:25.949190Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T11:30:25.949190Z","lead_time":1879.014}

{"text":"In hybrid perovskites, MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 have been extensively studied for their optical and photovoltaic properties, but MAPbCl3 is significantly less investigated for its optical and photovoltaic properties due to its low photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) and a large band gap. However, the large band gap makes it a suitable host for doping transition metal ions to explore new optical properties. We synthesized nanocrystals (NCs) of MAPbCl3 doped with Mn2+ by simple ligand assisted reprecipitation method. The reaction temperature and Pb to Mn feed ratio were optimized by preparing a series of Mn2+-doped MAPbCl3 NCs. The prepared NCs show bright Mn2+ emission with ~13% PL QY suggesting an efficient energy transfer from host NCs to Mn2+. Since the large bandgap of MAPbCl3 precludes the possibility of investigating temperature-dependent PL and lifetime measurements to understand the excited state dynamics, we carried out these experiments on Mn2+ doped MAPbCl2.7Br0.3 with the Br concentration adjusted to bring the bandgap of the alloyed system within the limits of the experimental technique. Our studies establish an anomalous behavior of Mn2+ PL emission in this host.

{"text":"Ag and Co co-doped La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ perovskites were prepared by the citric acid sol–gel method. The maximum solubility of Ag+ in LaMnO3 decreased with the increase of Co doped in B-site, which lead to the exsolution of excess Ag+ from A-site of perovskite. The exsolution progress is more favorable to the formation of uniform and stable Ag nanoparticles on the perovskite substrate. The non-thermal plasma (NTP) assisted La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ for soot catalytic combustion had been investigated under diesel exhaust gas conditions. When La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ was utilized as the catalyst without NTP, the soot could hardly be oxidized at 200 °C. However, when La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ was combined with NTP, the efficiency of soot removal was dramatically improved. The NTP-La0.5Ag0.5Mn0.8Co0.2O3-δ hybrid had the highest soot removal efficiency and CO2 selectivity. The combination of NTP and La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ could form a synergistic catalytic effect, which significantly promoted the combustion of soot at low temperature. The results of characterization and experiments indicated that the synergistic catalytic performance depended on the coordination of short-living species in plasma, adsorbed oxygen and Ag nanoparticles on surface of La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ. Based on these results, the reaction mechanism of plasma-catalyst hybrid for soot catalytic combustion was proposed.","meta":{"doi":"13"},"tokens":[[{"start":0,"end":2,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":7,"end":9,"text":"Co","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":10,"end":18,"text":"co-doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":19,"end":39,"text":"La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":40,"end":51,"text":"perovskites","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":73,"end":99,"text":"citric acid sol–gel method","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":127,"end":130,"text":"Ag+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":134,"end":141,"text":"LaMnO3 ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":172,"end":174,"text":"Co","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":175,"end":180,"text":"doped","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":231,"end":234,"text":"Ag+","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":250,"end":260,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":343,"end":345,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":346,"end":359,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":367,"end":377,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":427,"end":447,"text":"La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":452,"end":477,"text":"soot catalytic combustion","annotation":"APL"},{"start":542,"end":562,"text":"La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":583,"end":591,"text":"catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":664,"end":684,"text":"La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":774,"end":798,"text":"La0.5Ag0.5Mn0.8Co0.2O3-δ","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":850,"end":853,"text":"CO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1097,"end":1130,"text":"synergistic catalytic performance","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":1204,"end":1210,"text":"oxygen","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1215,"end":1217,"text":"Ag","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1218,"end":1231,"text":"nanoparticles","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":1246,"end":1266,"text":"La1-xAgxMn1-yCoyO3-δ","annotation":"MAT"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":13,"created_at":"2022-11-18T14:59:11.872267Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T14:59:11.872267Z","lead_time":594.767}
{"text":"Néel temperature (TN), the antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition temperature, is also one of the important magnetic properties of antiferromagnets. Antiferromagnets could be used to write and read information below TN in electronic memory devices. Perovskite manganites are an important antiferromagnetic material with superior magnetic properties. However, it is challengeable to seek novel perovskite manganites with TN higher than room temperature by trial-and-error method. In this work, the maximum correlation minimum redundancy (mRMR) integrated machine learning approaches were used to screen the optimal subset of features, which included chemical compositions and atomic parameters of perovskite manganites. The machine learning model called support vector regression (SVR) was constructed to predict the TN of perovskite manganites. The correlation coefficient (R) between experimental TN and predicted TN reached as high as 0.87 for the training set in leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and 0.86 for the independent testing set, respectively. The high-throughput screening of new perovskites with higher TN temperature was then carried out by using our online computation platform for materials data mining (OCPMDM). The TN of designed perovskite manganites (Sr0.7Pm0.3MnO3) was predicted to be 307.5K, increasing by 6% compared to the maximum TN of Sr0.9Ce0.1MnO3 (290K) reported.

{"text":"The CuSCN-containing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are presently of great research focus due to the high carrier mobility and well-aligned work function of the CuSCN hole-transporting layer. The improvement of photovoltaic performance and stability is still an important subject in the practical applications of CuSCN-containing PSCs. Herein, a facile approach to improve the efficiency and stability of CuSCN-containing PSCs is developed by spin-coating the triphenylamine-based macromolecules between the CuSCN hole-transporting layer and metallic electrode, such as linear macromolecule poly-TPD and branched macromolecule CRA-TPA. The maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CuSCN-containing PSCs is increased by linear triphenylamine-based macromolecule poly-TPD to 10.36% while the PCE value of CuSCN-containing PSCs, being modified by branched triphenylamine-based macromolecule CRA-TPA, reaches up to 11.97%. Evidently, the PCE values are nearly two times higher than 5.95% of CuSCN-containing control device. The photovoltaic improvement of macromolecule-modified CuSCN-containing PSCs is mainly caused by the strong hole-transporting capacity of triphenylamine-based macromolecules inducing the reduction of charge recombination, which is derived from the reduced potential barrier of hole transportation including the flatness and coverage improvement in the triphenylamine-based macromolecular functional layer. In addition, the stability of macromolecule-modified CuSCN-containing PSCs is significantly improved due to the protection of triphenylamine-based macromolecular layer on the perovskite film, so that the unencapsulated macromolecule-modified CuSCN-containing PSC device can keep over 70–80% of initial PCE value after 20-day exposure under ambient environment (relative humidity (RH) = 50%, 25°C).

Hole-transporting materials play a key role in improving the device performance of PVSCs by facilitating the extraction of photogenerated holes and their transport from the perovskite layer to the anode.

{"text":"In order to explore a superior washcoat material to give full play to the catalytic activity of perovskite active components on the monolithic catalysts, three novel types of LaCoO3/washcoat/cordierite monolith catalysts were prepared by a facile two-step procedure which employed the cordierite honeycomb ceramic as the monolith substrate, the nano-oxides (ZrO2, ɤ-Al2O3, TiO2) as the washcoat, and the perovskite of LaCoO3 as the active components. The blank cordierite, powdered LaCoO3, semi-manufactured monolithic catalysts (washcoat/cordierite), and manufactured monolithic catalysts (LaCoO3/washcoat/cordierite) were characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS, N2 adsorption–desorption, H2-TPR, and ultrasonic test, and their catalytic activities and catalytic stability were evaluated by the toluene oxidation test. The research results indicate that the nanoparticles coated on the cordierite substrate as the washcoat can give full play to the catalytic ability of the LaCoO3 active components and also showed high catalytic stability. However, the catalytic properties of the monolithic catalysts vary notably with the species of nano-washcoat. Among all the catalysts, the porous honeycomb surface structure, uniform distribution, high ratio of surface adsorbed oxygen, and strong reducing ability together give the LaCoO3/ZrO2/cordierite monolithic catalyst the highest catalytic activity on the oxidation of toluene at low temperature, which could be attributed to the excellent interactions of perovskite and nano-ZrO2 washcoat. Therefore, the nano-oxides, especially the nano-ZrO2, have a broad practical application potential for toluene oxidation at low temperature as the washcoat of perovskite-based monolithic catalysts.","meta":{"doi":"119360"},"tokens":[[{"start":175,"end":181,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":182,"end":190,"text":"washcoat","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":191,"end":220,"text":"cordierite monolith catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":281,"end":313,"text":"the cordierite honeycomb ceramic","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":358,"end":362,"text":"ZrO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":364,"end":371,"text":"ɤ-Al2O3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":373,"end":377,"text":"TiO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":345,"end":356,"text":"nano-oxides","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":418,"end":424,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":404,"end":414,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":96,"end":106,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":451,"end":471,"text":"The blank cordierite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":482,"end":488,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":490,"end":528,"text":"semi-manufactured monolithic catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":556,"end":589,"text":"manufactured monolithic catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":591,"end":597,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":598,"end":606,"text":"washcoat","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":607,"end":617,"text":"cordierite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":641,"end":644,"text":"XRD","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":646,"end":649,"text":"SEM","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":651,"end":654,"text":"XPS","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":656,"end":680,"text":"N2 adsorption–desorption","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":682,"end":688,"text":"H2-TPR","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":694,"end":709,"text":"ultrasonic test","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":784,"end":810,"text":"the toluene oxidation test","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":875,"end":899,"text":"the cordierite substrate","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":967,"end":973,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1071,"end":1095,"text":"the monolithic catalysts","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1169,"end":1207,"text":"the porous honeycomb surface structure","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1316,"end":1322,"text":"LaCoO3","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1323,"end":1327,"text":"ZrO2","annotation":"MAT"},{"start":1328,"end":1358,"text":"cordierite monolithic catalyst","annotation":"APL"},{"start":1497,"end":1507,"text":"perovskite","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1512,"end":1521,"text":"nano-ZrO2","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1547,"end":1558,"text":"nano-oxides","annotation":"SPL"},{"start":1575,"end":1584,"text":"nano-ZrO2","annotation":"SPL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":12,"created_at":"2022-11-22T01:56:53.058228Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T01:56:53.058228Z","lead_time":969.385}

Recently, additives have become necessary for the fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Additionally, alkali metal doping has been an effective method to decrease the defect density in the perovskite film. However, the traditional trial-and-error method to find the optimal doping concentration is time-consuming and needs a significant amount of raw materials. In this work, in order to explore new ways of facilitating the process of finding the optimal doping concentration in perovskite solar cells, we applied a machine learning (ML) approach to assist the optimization of KI doping in MAPbI3 solar cells. With the aid of ML technique, we quickly found that 3% KI doping could further improve the efficiency of MAPbI3 solar cells. As a result, a highest efficiency of 20.91% has been obtained for MAPbI3 solar cells.","meta":{"doi":"119359"},"tokens":[[{"start":61,"end":78,"text":"photovoltaic (PV)","annotation":"PRO"},{"start":0,"end":22,"text":"Perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":211,"end":240,"text":"perovskite solar cells (PSCs)","annotation":"APL"},{"start":256,"end":275,"text":"alkali metal doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":339,"end":358,"text":"the perovskite film","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":385,"end":407,"text":"trial-and-error method","annotation":"CMT"},{"start":634,"end":656,"text":"perovskite solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":671,"end":692,"text":"machine learning (ML)","annotation":"SMT"},{"start":732,"end":741,"text":"KI doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":745,"end":763,"text":"MAPbI3 solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":820,"end":829,"text":"KI doping","annotation":"DSC"},{"start":870,"end":888,"text":"MAPbI3 solar cells","annotation":"APL"},{"start":956,"end":974,"text":"MAPbI3 solar cells","annotation":"APL"}]],"labels": ["MAT", "DSC", "PRO", "SPL", "SMT", "CMT", "APL"],"annotation_id":11,"created_at":"2022-11-22T01:40:41.876012Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T01:40:41.876012Z","lead_time":1324.384}

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy (SEM-TEM) characterization of the calcined oxides confirmed the formation of a single perovskite-type structure in all the materials. The incorporation of cobalt into the structure was associated with an evolution from a rhombohedral R3-c to an orthorhombic Pnma 62 structure, with nanometric particle sizes and relevant surface properties. The results obtained from Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) evidenced that the chemical composition and the electronic state of the cations were in accordance with the proposed system and the employed synthesis method. The conversion of CO and O2 was between 83.5 and 100% for all oxides, depending on the cobalt content, and the positive effect of temperature on the conversion and the selectivity for the formation of CO2.

Theoretically, work function engineering of TiO2 electron transport layer can reduce both the loss of Voc and current hysteresis in PSCs. In this work, two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets were adopted to modify the compact TiO2 layers in planar PSCs, which can finely tune the work function (WF) and further improve the energy level alignment at the interface to enhance the Voc and diminish the hysteresis. Meanwhile, the quality of perovskite films and charge transfer of the devices were improved by g-C3N4 nanosheets. Therefore, the PCE of the planar PSCs was champed to 19.55% without obvious hysteresis compared with the initial 15.81%, mainly owing to the remarkable improvement of VOC from 1.01 to 1.11 V.
